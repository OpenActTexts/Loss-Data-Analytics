  annote    = {The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with an introduction to the mathematical theory underlying the financial models being used and developed at Wall Street. To this end, this book covers important concepts and results in measure theory, probability theory, stochastic processes, and stochastic calculus so that the reader will be in a position to understand these financial models. \\ An anonymous reviewer of this book said: ``\textit{Based only on the table of contents, purpose of the book, and the authors' credentials, I can say that this is an important and needed book. It would fill part of the existing informational gap in our knowledge structure, educational system, as well as in the market of quality books in finance. It would certainly help expand our understanding of how our financial markets work, both in theoretical and practical sense. I like the problem-solving approach for it is the only way to make perfect sense when it comes to applying mathematical analysis in real life situations. In order to really understand the dynamics of the financial market, and the behavior of different players in the market, it would not be enough to narrate the concepts, tell stories, and give instructions. Changes and fluctuations have to be quantified and patterns have to be modeled and graphically visualized. I would support the publication of this book.}'' \\ Another anonymous reviewer of this book said: ``\textit{The book under review caught my attention right from the title. I am a (cautious) supporter of Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), aka, `The Moore Method', wherein a subject area is presented to the audience through a well-chosen series of problems. The goal is to have the students build the theory themselves, and the instructor takes a less exposed role, namely, that of a moderator. The topics taught in IBL-based courses are usually drawn from point-set topology or elementary number theory; I was, therefore, quite surprised when I saw that Gan wants to apply the same methodological approach to my field, mathematical finance. They start with the basics (measure and integration theory and basic probability) and leads the reader all the way through, to the most important models of mathematical finance. This choice of topics is rather standard and forms a well-established canon of the discipline.}''},
