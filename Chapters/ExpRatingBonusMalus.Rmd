## Introduction {#S:ERBM:Intro}

`r Gloss('Bonus-malus system')`, which is used interchangeably as "no-fault
discount", "merit rating", "experience rating" or "no-claim discount" in
different countries, is based on penalizing insureds who are responsible
for one or more claims by a premium surcharge (malus), and rewarding insureds
with a premium discount (bonus) if they do not have any claims. Insurers use
bonus-malus systems for two main purposes: to encourage drivers to drive
more carefully in a year without any claims, and to ensure insureds to
pay premiums proportional to their risks based on their claims
experience via an experience rating mechanism. 

`r Gloss("No Claim Discount (NCD) system")` is an experience rating system commonly
used in motor insurance. It represents an attempt to categorize insureds
into homogeneous groups who pay premiums based on their claims
experience. Depending on the rules in the scheme, new policyholders may
be required to pay full premium initially, and obtain discounts in the
future years as a result of claim-free years. An *NCD* system rewards
policyholders for not making any claims during a year. In other
words, it grants a bonus to a careful driver. This bonus principle may
affect policy holders' decisions whether to claim or not to claim,
especially when involving accidents with slight damages, which is known
as the '`r Gloss('hunger for bonus')`' phenomenon. The 'hunger for bonus' under
an *NCD* system may reduce insurers' claim costs, and may be able to
offset the expected decrease in premium income.

## *NCD* System in Several Countries {#S:ERBM:NCD}

### *NCD* System in Malaysia

Before the liberalization of Motor Tariff on 1st July 2017, the rating
of motor insurance in Malaysia was governed by the Motor Tariff. Under the
tariff, the rate charged should not be lower than the rates specified
under the classes of risks, to ensure that the price competition among
insurers will not go below the country's economic level. The basic
rating factors considered were scope of insurance, cubic capacity of
vehicle and estimated value of vehicle (or sum insured, whichever is
lower). Under the Motor Tariff, the final premium to be paid is adjusted
by the policyholder's claim experience, or equivalently, his *NCD*
entitlement.

Effective on 1st July 2017, the premium rates for motor insurance are
liberalized, or de-tariffed. The pricing of premium is now determined by
individual insurers and `r Gloss('takaful')` operators, and the consumers are able to
enjoy a wider choice of motor insurance products at competitive prices.
Since tariff liberalization encourages innovation and competition among
insurers and takaful operators, the premiums are based on broader risk
factors other than the two rating factors specified in the Motor Tariff,
i.e. sum insured and cubic capacity of vehicle. Other rating factors may
be defined in the risk profile of an insured, such as age of vehicle,
age of driver, safety and security features of vehicle, geographical
location of vehicle and traffic offences of driver. As different
insurers and takaful operators have different ways of defining the risk
profile of an insured, the price of a policy may differ from one insurer
to another. However, the *NCD* structure from the Motor Tariff remains
'unchanged' and continue to exist, and is 'transferable' from one
insurer, or from one takaful operator, to another.

The discounts in the Malaysian *NCD* system are divided into six classes,
starting from the initial class of 0% discount, followed by classes of
25%, 30%, 38.3%, 45% and 55% discounts. [Table 12.1] provides the classes of
NCD system in Malaysia. A claim-free year indicates that a policyholder
is entitled to move one-step forward to the next discount class, such as
from a 0% discount to a 25% discount in the renewal year. If a
policyholder is already at the highest class, which is at a 55%
discount, a claim-free year indicates that the policyholder remains in
the same class. On the other hand, if one or more claims are made within
the year, the *NCD* will be forfeited and the policyholder has to start at
0% discount in the renewal year. This set of transition rules can also be 
summarized as a rule of -1/Top, that is, a class of bonus for a claim-free
year, and moving to the highest class after having one or more claims.
For an illustration purpose, [Table 12.1] and Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionMsia) respectively
show the classes and the transition diagram for the Malaysian *NCD* system.

### *NCD* System in Other Countries

The *NCD* system in Brazil are subdivided into seven classes, with the
following premium levels [@LemaireZi94]: 100, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, and
65. These premium levels are also equivalent to the following discount
classes: 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 45%. New policyholders have to
start at 0% discount, or at premium level of 100, and a claim-free year indicates
that a policyholder can move forward at a one-class discount. If one or
more claims incurred within the year, the policyholder has to move one-class
backward for each claim. [Table 12.2] and Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionBrazil)
respectively show the classes and the transition diagram for the *NCD*
system in Brazil. This set of transition rules can also be summarized as a rule
of -1/+1, that is, a class of bonus for a claim-free year, and a class of malus
for each claim reported.

The *NCD* system in Switzerland are subdivided into twenty-two classes, 
with the following premium levels:
270, 250, 230, 215, 200, 185, 170, 155, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80,
75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50 and 45 [@LemaireZi94]. These levels are
also equivalent to the following loadings (malus): 170%, 150%, 130%, 115%, 100%,
85%, 70%, 55%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, and the following discounts: 0%,
10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50% and 55%. New policyholders have
to start at 0% discount, or at premium level of 100, and a claim-free year
indicates that a policyholder can move one-class forward. If one or more
claims incurred within the year, the policyholder has to move
four-classes backward for each claim. [Table 12.3] and Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionSwitz) 
respectively show the classes and the transition diagram for the *NCD* system in Switzerland.
This set of transition rule can be summarized as a rule of -1/+4.

## *BMS* and Markov Chain Model {#S:ERBM:BMS}

A *BMS* can be represented by a discrete time `r Gloss('Markov chain')`. 
A stochastic process is said to possess the Markov property if the evolution 
of the process in the future depends only on the present state but not the past.
A discrete time Markov Chain is a Markov process with discrete state space.  


### Transition Probability

A Markov Chain is determined by its transition probabilities.
The ***transition probability*** from state $i$ (at time $n$) to state $j$ 
(at time $n + 1$) is called a one-step transition probability, and is denoted by
$p_{ij}(n,n+1) = Pr (X_{n + 1} = j|X_n = i)$, $i = 1,2,\ldots,k$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,k$. 
For general transition from time $m$ to time $n$, for $m<n$, by conditioning on
$X_{o}$ for $m\le o\le n$, we have the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation of 

$$
p_{ij}(m,n)=\sum_{l\in S} p_{il}(m,o)p_{lj}(o,n).
$$

A time-homogeneous Markov Chain satisfies the property of $p_{ij}(n,n+t)=p_{ij}^{(t)}$
for all $n$. For instance, we have $p_{ij}(n,n+1)=p_{ij}^{(1)}\equiv p_{ij}$. 
In this case, the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation can be written as 

$$
p_{ij}(0,m+n)=\sum_{l\in S} p_{il}(0,m)p_{lj}(m,m+n)=\sum_{l\in S}p_{il}^{(m)}p_{lj}^{(n)}.
$$

In the context of *BMS*, the transition of the *NCD* classes is governed by the transition probability in a given year. The transition of the *NCD* classes is also a time-homogeneous Markov Chain since the set of transition rules is fixed and independent of time. We can represent the one-step transition probabilities by a $k \times k$ *transition matrix* ${\bf P}=(p_{ij})$ that corresponds to *NCD* classes $0,1,2,\ldots,k-1$.  

$$
\small{
{\bf P} = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
p_{00} & p_{01} & \ldots & & & p_{0k-1} \\
p_{10} & p_{11} & \ldots & & & p_{1k-1} \\ 
\vdots & \ddots & & & & \vdots \\
p_{k-10} & p_{k-11} & \cdots & & & p_{k-1k-1}   
\end{array} } \right]
}
$$

Here, its $(i,j)$-th element is the transition probability from state $i$ to 
state $j$. In other words, each row of the `r Gloss('transition matrix')` 
represents the transition of flowing out of state, whereas each column 
represents the transition of flowing into the state. The summation of transition
probabilities of flowing out of state must equal to 1, or each row of the matrix 
must sum to 1, i.e. $\sum_j p_{ij} = 1$. All probabilities must also
be non-negative (since they are probabilities), i.e. $p_{ij} \ge 0$.

Consider the Malaysian *NCD* system. Let $\{X_{t}:t=0,1,2,\ldots\}$ be the *NCD* class
occupied by a policyholder at time $t$ with state space $S=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$. 
Therefore, the transition probability in a no-claim year is equal to the probability 
of transition from state $i$ to state $i+1$, i.e. $p_{ii+1}$. If an insured has 
one or more claims within the year, the probability of transitioning back to state
0 is represented by $p_{i0}=1-p_{ii+1}$. Hence, the Malaysian *NCD* system can be
represented by the following $6\times 6$ transition matrix:

$$
\small{
{\bf P} = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
p_{00}&p_{01}&0&0&0&0\\
p_{10}&0&p_{12}&0&0&0\\
p_{20}&0&0&p_{23}&0&0\\
p_{30}&0&0&0&p_{34}&0\\
p_{40}&0&0&0&0&p_{45}\\
p_{50}&0&0&0&0&p_{55}
\end{array} }\right] = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
{1 - p_{01}}&p_{01}&0&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{12}}&0&p_{12}&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{23}}&0&0&p_{23}&0&0\\
{1 - p_{34}}&0&0&0&p_{34}&0\\
{1 - p_{45}}&0&0&0&0&p_{45}\\
{1 - p_{55}}&0&0&0&0&p_{55}
\end{array} }\right]
}
$$


**Example `r chapnum`.3.1.** 
Provide the transition matrix for the *NCD* system in Brazil.

`r HideExample('12.3.1','Show Example Solution')`

**Solution**

Based on the *NCD* classes and the transition diagram shown respectively
in [Table 12.2] and Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionBrazil), the probability of a no-claim year is equal to
the probability of moving one-class forward, whereas the probability of
having one or more claims within the year is equal to the probability of
moving one-class backward for each claim. Therefore, each row can contain two or more
transition probabilities; one probability for advancing to the next
state, and one or more probabilities for moving one-class backward. The
transition matrix is:

$$
\small{
{\bf P} = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{1 - p_{01}}&p_{01}&0&0&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{12}}&0&p_{12}&0&0&0&0\\

## *BMS* and Stationary Distribution {#S:ERBM:StatDist}

### Stationary Distribution

A stationary distribution of a Markov Chain is a probability distribution that 
remains unchanged as time progresses into the future. It is represented by 
a row vector $\boldsymbol \pi =(\pi_{1},\pi_{2},\ldots,\pi_{k})$ with the following properties:

\begin{align*}
0\le \pi_{j}\le 1,\\
\sum\limits_{j}\pi_{j}=1,\\
\pi_{j}=\sum\limits_{i}\pi_{i}p_{ij}.
\end{align*}

The last equation can be written as $\boldsymbol\pi \bf P=\boldsymbol\pi$. The first two conditions are 
necessary for probability distribution whereas the last property indicates that
the row vector $\boldsymbol\pi$ is invariant (i.e. unchanged) by the one-step transition
matrix. In other words, once the Markov Chain has reached the stationary state,
its probability distribution will stay stationary over time. Mathematically,
the stationary vector $\boldsymbol\pi$ can also be obtained by finding the left eigenvector
of the one-step transition matrix.

**Example `r chapnum`.4.1.** 
Find the stationary distribution for the *NCD* system in Malaysia assuming that the probability of a no-claim year for all *NCD* classes are ${p_0}$.

`r HideExample('12.4.1','Show Example Solution')`


**Solution.**
The transition matrix can be re-written as:

$$
\small{
{\bf P} = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
{1 - p_{0}}&p_{0}&0&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{0}}&0&p_{0}&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{0}}&0&0&p_{0}&0&0\\
{1 - p_{0}}&0&0&0&p_{0}&0\\
{1 - p_{0}}&0&0&0&0&p_{0}\\
{1 - p_{0}}&0&0&0&0&p_0
\end{array} }\right]
}
$$


The stationary distribution can be calculated using $\pi_{j}=\sum\limits_{i}\pi_{i}p_{ij}$. The solutions are:

$$
\small{
\begin{array}{lll}
{\pi _0} = \sum\limits_i {\pi_i}p_{i0} = (1 - {p_0})\sum\limits_i {{\pi _i}} = 1 - {p_0}\\
{\pi _1} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i1} = {\pi_0}{p_{01}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}\\
{\pi _2} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i2} = {\pi _1}{p_{12}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^2\\
{\pi _3} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i3} = {\pi _2}{p_{23}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^3\\
{\pi _4} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i4} = {\pi _3}{p_{34}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^4\\
{\pi _5} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i5} = {\pi _4}{p_{45}} + {\pi _5}{p_{55}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^5 + {\pi _5}{p_0}\\
\therefore {\pi _5} = \frac{(1 - {p_0}){p_0}^5}{{(1 - {p_0})}} = {p_0}^5
\end{array}
}
$$

*** 

</div>

The stationary distribution shown in Example `r chapnum`.4.1 represents the asymptotic  distribution of the *NCD* system, or the distribution in the long run. As an example, assuming that the probability of a no-claim year is $p_0 = 0.90,$ the ***stationary probabilities*** are:

$$
\small{
\begin{array}{l}
{\pi _0} = 1 - {p_0} = 0.1000\\
{\pi _1} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0} = 0.0900\\
{\pi _2} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^2 = 0.0810\\
{\pi _3} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^3 = 0.0729\\
{\pi _4} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^4 = 0.0656\\
{\pi _5} = {p_0}^5 = 0.5905
\end{array}
}
$$

In other words, ${\pi_0} = 0.10$ indicates that 10% of insureds will eventually belong to class 0, ${\pi _1} = 0.09$ indicates that 
9% of insureds will eventually belong to class 1, and so forth, until ${\pi _5} = 0.59$, which indicates that 59% of
insureds will eventually belong to class 5.

### `R` Code for a Stationary Distribution

We can use the left eigenvector of a transition matrix to calculate a stationary distribution. The following `R` code can be used to
calculate the left eigenvector:

**1. Create a Transition Matrix**

```{r LeftEigen1, eval=FALSE}
#create transition matrix
entries = c(0.1,0.9,0,0,0,0,
            0.1,0,0.9,0,0,0,
            0.1,0,0,0.9,0,0,
            0.1,0,0,0,0.9,0,
            0.1,0,0,0,0,0.9,
            0.1,0,0,0,0,0.9)
(TP <- matrix(entries,nrow=6,byrow=TRUE) )
```

`r HideRCode('LeftEigen.1', 'Show R Output')`

```{r echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'LeftEigen1', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
```

</div>


**2.  Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the `eigen` function**

```{r LeftEigen2, eval=FALSE}
#hint -- left eigenvector is the same as right eigenvector of transpose 
#of transition matrix
eigenTP <- eigen(t(TP))
signif(eigenTP$values, digits = 3)
signif(eigenTP$vectors, digits = 3)
```

`r HideRCode('LeftEigen.2', 'Show R Output')`

```{r echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'LeftEigen2', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
```

</div>


**3. Calculate the left eigenvector**

```{r LeftEigen3, eval=FALSE}
#divide entry of first column by sum of elements, so that entries sum to 1
#provide answers in 4 decimal places
signif(eigen(t(TP))$vectors[,1]/sum(eigen(t(TP))$vectors[,1]), digits = 4)
```

`r HideRCode('LeftEigen.3', 'Show R Output')`

```{r echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'LeftEigen3', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
```

\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0\\
{0.0047}&{0.0905}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0\\
{0.0002}&{0.0045}&{0.0905}&0&{0.9048}&0&0\\
{0.0000}&{0.0002}&{0.0045}&{0.0905}&0&{0.9048}&0\\
{0.0000}&{0.0000}&{0.0002}&{0.0045}&{0.0905}&0&{0.9048}\\
{0.0000}&{0.0000}&{0.0000}&{0.0002}&{0.0045}&{0.0905}&{0.9048}
\end{array}}\right]
}
$$

Using `R` code, the stationary probabilities are:

$$
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{{\pi _0}}\\
{{\pi_1}}\\
{{\pi _2}}\\
{{\pi _3}}\\
{{\pi _4}}\\
{{\pi_5}}\\
{{\pi _6}}

\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0000}\\
{0.0000}\\
{0.0003}\\
{0.0022}\\
{0.0145}\\
{0.0936}\\
{0.8894}
\end{array}} \right] .
$$

The probabilities indicate that 89% of insureds will eventually belong
to class 6, 9% of insureds will eventually belong to class 5, and
1.5% of insureds will eventually belong to class 4. Other classes would 
have less than 1% of insureds in the long run.

**Example `r chapnum`.4.3.** 
Using the results from Example `r chapnum`.4.2, find the final premium under the steady state condition assuming that the premium prior to implementing
the *NCD* is $m$.

`r HideExample('12.4.3','Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.**
Using the stationary probabilities from Example `r chapnum`.4.2, the stationary final premium is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 
\sum\limits_j \text{(premium)} \times 
\text{(proportion in class } j \text{ in the long run)} \times \text{(1 - *NCD* in class } j)\\ 
= m[{\pi _0}(1) + {\pi _1}(1 - 0.9) + {\pi _2}(1 - 0.15) + \ldots + {\pi _6}(1 - 0.35)]\\ 
= m[0 + 0 + (0.0003)(0.85) + \ldots + (0.8894)(0.65)]\\
= 0.6565m .
\end{array}
$$

*** 

</div>


The results indicate that the final premium reduce from $m$ to $0.6565m$ in
the long run under stationary condition if the *NCD* is considered. From a
financial standpoint, this implies that the collected premium is insufficient 
to cover the expected claim cost of $m$. This result is not surprising 
because none of the classes in the *NCD* system in Brazil impose a malus 
loading for the policyholders. More importantly, it indicates that *NCD* will 
only be financially balanced if there are both bonus and malus classes 
and the premium levels are re-calculated such that the expected premium 
under the stationary distribution equals to $m$.



### Premium Evolution

We may be interested to find out the evolution of the mean premium after $n$ years (or $n$ steps). Under the *NCD* system, 
the n-step transition probability, $p_{ij}^{(n)}=\Pr(X_{n}=j|X_{0}=i)$, can be used to calculate the evolution of the mean premium. The probability
$p_{ij}^{(n)}$ can be obtained as the $(i,j)$-th element of the $n$-th power of transition matrix ${\bf P}$, that is, ${\bf P}^{n}$.  

**Example `r chapnum`.4.4.** 
Observe the premiums in 20 years under the *NCD* system in Malaysia, assuming that the probability of claims is Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda = 0.10$ and the premium prior to implementing the *NCD* is $m = 100$.

`r HideExample('12.4.4','Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.**
Under the Malaysian *NCD*, we use the Poisson probability,* $p_k = \frac{e^{ - 0.1}{(0.1)}^k}{k!}$, only for $k = 0,1$. Therefore, the transition matrix in the first year is:

$$
\small{
{\bf{P}^{(1)}} = 
\left[{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&0&{0.9048}&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&{0.9048}&0\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}
\end{array}} \right]
}
$$

The premium in the first year, after implementing the *NCD*, is:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
&= \sum\limits_j \text{(premium)} \times 
\text{(average proportion in class } j) \times \text{(1 - *NCD* in class }j) \\
&= m\left[ \frac{\sum\limits_i {p_{i0}}}{6}{(1)} +
\frac{\sum\limits_i {p_{i1}}}{6}{(1 - 0.25)} + \ldots +
\frac{\sum\limits_i {p_{i5}}}{6}{(1 - 0.55)} \right]\\
&=
100[0.0952(1) + 0.1508(0.75) + \cdots + 0.3016(0.45)]\\
&= 62.55.
\end{aligned}
$$

Using similar steps, the premium in the $n$-th year for
$n = 1,2,...,20$ can be observed. From `R`, the premiums in 20 years are:

62.55, 59.87, 58.06, 57.06, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58,

56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58.

### `R` Program for Premium Evolution

The following `R` code can be used to find the premium in the *n-*th year and the premiums in 20 years under the *NCD* system in Malaysia (to
find the solution in Example `r chapnum`.4.4).

**1. Create a Transition Matrix**

```{r PremEvol1, eval=FALSE}
#create transition matrix
entries = c(0.0952,0.9048,0,0,0,0,
            0.0952,0,0.9048,0,0,0,

            0.0952,0,0,0,0.9048,0,
            0.0952,0,0,0,0,0.9048,
            0.0952,0,0,0,0,0.9048)
(TP <- matrix(entries,nrow=6,byrow=TRUE) )
```

`r HideRCode('PremEvol.1', 'Show R Output')`

```{r echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'PremEvol1', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
```

</div>

**2. Create a function for the $n$th power of a square matrix**

```{r PremEvol2, eval=FALSE}
#create function for nth power of square matrix
powA <- function(n) { 
  if (n==1) return (TP)
  if (n==2) return (TP%*%TP)
  if (n>2) return ( TP%*%powA(n-1))}
#example for n=3
signif(powA(3), digits = 3)
```

`r HideRCode('PremEvol.2', 'Show R Output')`

```{r echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'PremEvol2', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
```

</div>


**3. create function for premium in nth year**

```{r PremEvol3, eval=FALSE}
#define NCD percentage
NCD = c(1,.75,.7,.6167,.55,.45)

#create function for premium in nth year
p = numeric(0)
prem <- function(n){
  for (j in 1:length(NCD))
         p[j] = mean(powA(n)[,j])
         100*sum(p*NCD)
         }
#example for n=3
signif(prem(3), digits = 3)
```

`r HideRCode('PremEvol.3', 'Show R Output')`

```{r echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'PremEvol3', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
```

</div>

**4.  Provide Premiums for 20 years**

```{r PremEvol4, eval=FALSE}
premium=numeric(0)
for (n in 1:20) {premium[n] = prem(n) }
signif(premium, digits = 2)
```


`r HideRCode('PremEvol.4', 'Show R Output')`

```

**Example `r chapnum`.4.5.** 
Observe the premiums in 20 years under the *NCD* system in Brazil, assuming that the probability of $k$ claims is $p_k = \frac{e^{-0.1}{(0.1)}^k}{k!}, \ \ k = 0,1,2,\ldots$, and the premium prior to implementing the *NCD* is $m = 100$.

`r HideExample('12.4.5','Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.**
The transition matrix for the *NCD* system in Brazil is:

$$
{\bf P} = \left[
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0\\
{0.0047}&{0.0905}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0\\
{0.0002}&{0.0045}&{0.0905}&0&{0.9048}&0&0\\
{0.0000}&{0.0002}&{0.0045}&{0.0905}&0&{0.9048}&0\\

\end{array}} \right]
$$

Using `R`, the premiums in 20 years are:

76.69, 73.76, 71.31, 69.38, 67.92, 66.93, 66.40, 66.05, 65.88, 65.78,

65.72, 65.69, 65.67, 65.66, 65.66, 65.66, 65.66, 65.65, 65.65, 65.65.

The results in Examples `r chapnum`.4-5 allow us to observe the evolution of premium for the *NCD* systems in Malaysia and Brazil assuming that the number of claims is Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda = 0.10$, and the premium prior to implementing the *NCD* is $m = 100$. The evolution of premiums for both countries are provided in [Table 12.4], and are shown graphically in Figure \@ref(fig:PremEvolution).

### Convergence Rate

We may also be interested to determine the variation between the probability in the *n*-th year, $p_{ij}^{(n)}$, and the
stationary probability, $\pi _j$. The variation between the probabilities can be measured using:

$$
\left| {average(p_{ij}^{(n)}) - {\pi _j}} \right|.
$$

Therefore, the total variation can be measured by the sum of variation
in all classes:

$$
\sum\limits_j {\left| {average(p_{ij}^{(n)}) - {\pi _j}} \right|}.
$$

The total variation is also called the `r Gloss('convergence rate')` because it measures the convergence rate after $n$ years (or $n$ transitions). A lower
total variation implies a better convergence rate between the $n$-step transition probabilities and the stationary distribution.

**Example `r chapnum`.4.6.** 
Provide the total variations (convergence rate) in 20 years under the *NCD* system in Malaysia, assuming that the probability of claims is Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda = 0.10$.

`r HideExample('12.4.6','Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.**
Using `R`, the stationary probabilities are:

$$
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{{\pi _0}}\\{{\pi_1}}\\{{\pi _2}}\\
{{\pi _3}}\\{{\pi _4}}\\{{\pi_5}}
\end{array}} \right]
= \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}\\{0.0861}\\{0.0779}\\
{0.0705}\\{0.0638}\\{0.6064}
\end{array}} \right]
$$

The transition matrix in the first year is:

$$
{\bf{P}}^{(1)} = \left[
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&0&{0.9048}&0&0\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&{0.9048}&0\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}
\end{array}} \right]
$$

The variation can be computed as:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\left| {\sum\limits_i {\frac{p_{i0}^{}}{6}} - {\pi _0}} \right| = 0\\
\left|{\sum\limits_i {\frac{p_{i1}^{}}{6}} - {\pi _1}} \right| =
0.0647\\
\vdots \\
\left| {\sum\limits_i
\frac{p_{i5}}{6} - {\pi _5}} \right| =
.3048
\end{array}
$$

Therefore, the total variation in the first year is

$$
\sum\limits_j {\left| {\sum\limits_i {\frac{p_{ij}}{6} - {\pi _j}} } \right|} = 0.6096 .
$$

Using `R`, the total variations (or convergence rate) in 20 years are:

0.6096, 0.3941, 0.2252, 0.0958, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

### `R` Program for Convergence Rate

for (n in 1:20) {tot.var[n] = TV(n)}
signif(tot.var,4)
```

**Solution.**
Using `R` code, the total variations (or convergence rates) in 20 years for the *NCD* system in Brazil are:

1.2617, 1.0536, 0.8465, 0.6412, 0.4362, 0.2316, 0.1531, 0.0747, 0.0480, 0.0232,

0.0145, 0.0071, 0.0043, 0.0021, 0.0013, 0.0006, 0.0004, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.0001.

</div>

Examples `r chapnum`.4.6-7 provide the degree of convergence for two different *BMS* (two different countries). The Malaysian *BMS* reaches full stationary
only after five years, while the *BMS* in Brazil takes a longer period. As mentioned in @Lemaire98, a more sophisticated *BMS* would converge
more slowly, and is considered as a drawback as it takes a longer period to stabilize. The main objective of a *BMS* is to separate the good
drivers from the bad drivers, and thus, it is desirable to have a classification process that can be finalized (or stabilized) as soon as
possible.

## *BMS* and Premium Rating {#S:PremRtg}

### Premium Rating

In motor insurance ratemaking, *BMS* is a form of *a posteriori* rating mechanism 
to complement the use of *a priori* risk classification. The *a priori* 
*risk segmentation* divides portfolio of drivers into a number of homogeneous 
risk classes based on observable characteristics, such that policyholders in
the same risk class pay the same *a priori* premium. The underlying reason 
for utilizing *BMS* that relies on claims experience information is to deal 
with the *residual heterogeneity* within each homogeneous risk class since 
the observable variables are far from perfect in predicting the riskiness of driving behaviors.

The ideal *a posteriori* mechanism is the credibility premium 
[see @DionneVanasse89] framework, whereby premiums are derived on an 
individual basis for each policyholder by incorporating both the *a priori* and 
*a posteriori* information. However, such individual premium determination is 
overly complex from a commercial standpoint for practical implementations by 
motor insurers. For this reason, *BMS* is the preferred solution and it consists
of the following three building blocks: (a) *BMS* classes; (b) transition rules; 
(c) premium levels (also known as premium relativities or premium adjustment coefficients).
The first two building blocks are pre-specified in advance and have been discussed
in previous sections, whereas the determination (instead of pre-determined as discussed 
in the cases of Malaysian, Brazilian and Swiss systems) of premium relativities 
are important for motor insurers precisely because of its complementary and correction 
nature to account for the imperfection or inaccuracies in the *a priori* 
risk classification. In the following subsections, we briefly introduce the required
modelling setup to study the determination of optimal relativities. We refer interested
reader to @Denuit07 for a fuller discussion on the technical details. 

### A Priori Risk Classification

Let us consider a portfolio of $n$ policies, where the risk exposure of driver $i$
is denoted as $d_{i}$ and the number of claims reported is represented by $N_{i}$.
Let ${\bf X}_{i}^{T}=(X_{i1},X_{i2},\ldots, X_{iq})$ be the vector of observable 
variables for $i=1,2,\ldots, n$. The Poisson regression is commonly chosen to model
$N_{i}$ under the generalized linear models (GLM) framework, see @McCullaghNelder89. 

We can express the predicted *a priori* expected claim frequency for policyholder 
$i$ as 

$$
\lambda_{i}=d_{i}\exp\left(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\sum\limits_{m=1}^{q}\hat{\beta}_{m}x_{im}\right) ,
$$

where $\hat{\beta}_{0},\hat{\beta}_{1},\ldots,\hat{\beta}_{q}$ are the estimated
regression coefficients.

### Modelling of Residual Heterogeneity
Since unobserved factors that may affect driving behaviors are not taken into account 
in estimating the expected claim frequency, insurers would have to account 
for the residual heterogeneity within each *a priori* risk class by introducing 
a random effect component $\Theta_{i}$ into the conditional distribution of $N_{i}$.
Given $\Theta_{i}=\theta$, $N_{i}$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean 
$\lambda_{i}\theta$, that is, 

$$
\Pr(N_{i}=k|\Theta_{i}=\theta)=\exp(-\lambda_{i}\theta)\frac{(\lambda_{i}\theta)^{k}}{k!},k=0,1,2,\ldots.
$$

We further assume that all the $\Theta_{i}$'s are independent and follow a gamma $(a,a)$ distribution with the following density function

$$
f(\theta)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(a)}a^{a}\theta^{a-1}\exp(-a\theta), \quad \theta > 0,
$$

where the use of Poisson-gamma mixture produces a negative binomial distribution for $N_{i}$. With these specifications, we obtain $\mathbb{E}(\Theta_{i})=1$ and  hence $\mathbb{E}(N_{i})=\mathbb{E}(\mathbb{E}(N_{i}|\Theta_{i}))=\mathbb{E}(\lambda_{i}\Theta_{i})=\lambda_{i}$.

### Stationary Distribution Allowing for Residual Heterogeneity 

Suppose that a driver is selected at random from the portfolio that has been 
classified into $h$ risk classes via the use of observed *a priori* variables. 
The true expected claim frequency for this driver is given by $\Lambda\Theta$,
where $\Lambda$ is the unknown *a priori* expected claim frequency and $\Theta$ 
is the random residual heterogeneity. Let us further denote $w_{g}$ as the proportion
of drivers in the $g$-th risk class, that is, $w_{g}=\Pr(\Lambda=\lambda_{g})=\frac{n_{g}}{n}$
where $n_{g}$ is the number of drivers classified in the $g$-th risk class. Note 
that since there are two different concepts of risk classes (from *a priori* risk classification)
and *BMS* (or *NCD*) classes (for *a posteriori* rating mechanism), for the rest 
of this chapter we will refer *BMS* classes as *BMS* levels instead 
to avoid unnecessary confusion.

Let $p_{ij}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta)$ be the transition probability of moving from 
BMS level $i$ to level $j$ for a driver with expected claim frequency $\lambda\theta$ 
belonging to the risk class with predicted claim frequency of $\lambda$. In other words,
the one-step transition matrix can be written as ${\bf P}(\lambda\theta; \lambda)=\{p_{ij}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta)\}$. The row vector of the stationary 
distribution $\boldsymbol \pi=(\pi_{0}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta),\pi_{1}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta),\ldots,\pi_{k-1}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta))$ can be obtained by solving the following conditions:
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol\pi(\lambda\theta;\lambda)&=\boldsymbol\pi(\lambda\theta;\lambda){\bf P}(\lambda\theta;\lambda)\\
\boldsymbol\pi(\lambda\theta;\lambda){\bf 1}&=1,
\end{align*}
where $\bf 1$ is the column vector of $1$'s and $\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta)$
is the stationary probability for a driver with true expected claim frequency of
$\lambda\theta$ to be in level $\ell$ when the equilibrium steady state 
is reached in the long run. Note that with the incorporation of random effect
parameter $\theta$, the expression (not numerical values) for 
$\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta)$ can be found by say MATLAB but not R. 

With these setup, the probability of drivers staying in *BMS* level $L=\ell$ for 
$\ell=0,1,\ldots,k-1$ in the  context of the entire portfolio can be obtained as

### Determination of Optimal Relativities

The ***optimal relativity*** for each *BMS* level was first derived by @Norberg76
through the minimization of the following objective function, which is more commonly
known as the Norberg's criterion:
$$\min \mathbb{E}\left((\bar{\lambda}\Theta-\bar{\lambda}r_{L})^{2}\right)\equiv\min\mathbb{E}\left((\Theta-r_{L})^{2}\right),$$
where $\hat{\lambda}$ is the constant expected claim frequency for all policyholders
in the absence of *a priori* risk classification and $r_{L}$ is the premium relativity for
BMS level $L$. @Pitrebois03 then incorporated the information of *a priori* 
risk classification into the optimization of the same objective function of 
$$\min\mathbb{E}\left((\Theta-r_{L})^{2}\right)$$ to derive $r_{L}$ analytically.
@Tan15 further proposed the minimization of the following objective function 
$$\min\mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda r_{L})^{2}\right), \text{ subject to } \mathbb{E}(r_{L})=1,$$
under a financial balanced constraint (that is, the expected premium relativity equals 1) to determine the optimal relativities of a *BMS* given pre-specified *BMS* levels and transition rules, where 
\begin{align*}
\min\mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda r_{L})^{2}\right)&=\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda r_{L})^{2}|L=\ell\right)\Pr(L=\ell)\\
&=\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda r_{L})^{2}|L=\ell,\Lambda\right)|L=\ell\right)\Pr(L=\ell)\\
&=\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}\mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda r_{L})^{2}|L=\ell,\Lambda=\lambda_{g}\right)\times\Pr\left(\Lambda=\lambda_{g}|L=\ell\right)\Pr(L=\ell)\\
&=\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}\int_{0}^{\infty}(\lambda_{g}\theta-\lambda_{g}r_{\ell})^{2}\pi_{\ell}(\lambda_{g}\theta)w_{g}f(\theta)d\theta\\
&=\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}w_{g}\int_{0}^{\infty}\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}(\lambda_{g}\theta-\lambda_{g}r_{\ell})^{2}\pi_{\ell}(\lambda_{g}\theta)f(\theta)d\theta.
\end{align*}
It is crucially important that the optimal relativity has an average of 100\%, 
so that the bonuses and maluses exactly offset each other to result in a 
financial equilibrium condition. Note that the approach considered by @Pitrebois03 
does not require the financial balanced constraint because the analytical solution
to its objective function is given by $r_{\ell}=\mathbb{E}(\Theta|L=\ell)$, so it
follows that $\mathbb{E}(r_{L})=\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbb{E}(\Theta|L)\right)=\mathbb{E}(\Theta)=1$
with the specific choice of Gamma $(a,a)$ distribution for the random
effect component $\Theta$.

In this case, the optimization problem can be solved by specifying the Lagrangian
as 
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}({\bf r}, \alpha)&=\mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda r_{L})^{2}\right)+\alpha(\mathbb{E}(r_{L})-1)\\
&=\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1} \mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda r_{L})^{2}|L=\ell\right)\Pr(L=\ell)+\alpha\left(\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}r_{\ell}\Pr(L=\ell)-1\right),
\end{align*}
where ${\bf r}=(r_{0},r_{1},\ldots,r_{k-1})^{T}$. The required first order conditions
are given as follows
\begin{align*}
\Pr(L=\ell)\times \left(2\mathbb{E}\left(\Lambda^{2}\Theta-\Lambda^{2}r_{L}|L=\ell\right)-\alpha\right)&=0, \qquad \ell=0,1,\ldots, k-1,\\
\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}r_{\ell}\Pr(L=\ell)-1&=0.
\end{align*}
Finally, the solution set for $\alpha$ and $r_{\ell}, \ell=0,1,\ldots,k-1$
is obtained as 
\begin{align*}
\alpha&=\frac{\left(\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}\frac{\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}\Theta|L=\ell)\Pr(L=\ell)}{\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}|L=\ell)}\right)-1}{\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}\frac{\Pr(L=\ell)}{2\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}|L=\ell)}},\\
r_{\ell}&=\frac{\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}\Theta|L=\ell)}{\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}|L=\ell)}-\frac{\alpha}{2\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}|L=\ell)},
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
\Pr(L=\ell)&=\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}w_{g}\int_{0}^{\infty}\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda_{g}}(\lambda_{g}\theta)f(\theta)d\theta,\\
\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}\Theta|L=\ell)&=\frac{\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}w_{g}\int_{0}^{\infty}\lambda_{g}^{2}\theta\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda_{g}}(\lambda_{g}\theta)f(\theta)d\theta}{\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}w_{g}\int_{0}^{\infty}\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda_{g}}(\lambda_{g}\theta)f(\theta)d\theta},\\
\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}|L=\ell)&=\frac{\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}w_{g}\int_{0}^{\infty}\lambda_{g}^{2}\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda_{g}}(\lambda_{g}\theta)f(\theta)d\theta}{\sum\limits_{g=1}^{h}w_{g}\int_{0}^{\infty}\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda_{g}}(\lambda_{g}\theta)f(\theta)d\theta}.
\end{align*}
If we perform the optimization without the financial balanced constraint, then we obtain
\begin{align*}
\alpha^{\text{unconstrained}}&=0,\\
r_{\ell}^{\text{unconstrained}}&=\frac{\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}\Theta|L=\ell)}{\mathbb{E}(\Lambda^{2}|L=\ell)}.
\end{align*}

### Numerical Illustrations 

In this section, we present two numerical illustrations that integrate *a priori* information into the determination of optimal relativities. We consider
the *BMS* levels and the transition rules of both Malaysian and Brazilian systems but choose to calculate the set of optimal relativities instead of the 
specified premium levels given earlier. In our illustrations, we also assume that the following 3 values of *a priori* expected claim frequency are given  
$\lambda_{1}=0.1$,$\lambda_{2}=0.3$, and $\lambda_{3}=0.5$ with the following proportions 

$$
\Pr(\Lambda=\lambda_{1})=0.6, \Pr(\Lambda=\lambda_{2})=0.3, \Pr(\Lambda=\lambda_{3})=0.1.
$$

We also assume that the gamma parameteris fixed at $a=1.5$. Note that while these modelling assumptions are simple, the purpose here is to demonstrate the 
determination of optimal relativities under a relatively simple setup, and that the optimization procedure for the *BMS* remains the same even if the 
*a priori* risk classification is performed extensively. We refer interested readers to the motor vehicle claims data as documented in @Dejong08 
to conduct the *a priori* risk segmentation before proceeding to the determination of optimal relativities.

Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the inclusion of random effect parameter $\theta$ implies that the required expression (not numerical values) for 
stationary probabilities $\pi_{\ell}^{\lambda}(\lambda\theta)$ to be used 
for subsequent integrals can be found by say MATLAB but not `R`. Also, since the 
obtained form of stationary probabilities are rather complex, in this section we
choose not to include any `R` codes for the determination of optimal relativities.
More importantly, we hope that the key take-away for this subsection is for readers to
get a solid overall conceptual understanding on how to account for all 
the relevant information in the design of a bonus-malus system. 

For the Malaysian *BMS* with 6 levels and the transition rule of -1/Top,
the obtained numerical values of optimal relativities are presented in [Table 12.5] 
together with the stationary probabilities. We find that around half of the policyholders
will occupy the highest *BMS* level with the lowest premium relativity over the long run 
when the stationary state has been reached. We also observe that the constrained 
optimal relativities are higher than the unconstrained counterparts because of the
need to satisfy the financial balanced constraint.

\small{
\begin{array}{*{20}c}
\hline
\text{Level }\ell & \Pr(L=\ell) & r_{\ell} & r_{\ell}^{\text{unconstrained}}\\
\hline
{0} & {16.22\%} & {131.99\%} & {126.33\%}\\
{1} & {11.29\%} & {127.33\%} & {120.66\%}\\
{2} & {8.49\%} & {120.64\%} & {113.03\%}\\

{E(r_{L})} & & {100\%} & {88.87\%} \\
\hline
\end{array}
}
$$

Moreover, we see that except for the highest *BMS* level (level 5), 
other *BMS* levels will impose malus surcharges to policyholders occupying 
those levels. This finding is not surprising since our 
theoretical framework here is to determine optimal relativities given the calculation
of *a priori* base premiums by solely relying on claim frequency information 
but not claim severity. In practice, insurers could afford to introduce 
NCD levels with only discounts (bonuses) but not loadings (maluses) because 
the *a priori* base premiums have been inflated accordingly taking into account
both the information of claim frequency and claim severity. 

For the Brazilian *BMS* with 7 levels and the transition rule of -1/+1,
the corresponding numerical values of optimal relativities are shown in [Table 12.6]. 
We find that around three quarters of the policyholders will occupy the highest *BMS* level 
with the lowest premium relativity in the stationary state. This finding is 
mainly due to the less severe penalty in the transition rule of -1/+1 
in comparison to the rule of -1/Top, so more policyholders are expected to 
occupy the highest *BMS* level. Similar to the earlier example, we find that the unconstrained 
optimal relativities are lower and result in a lower value of $\mathbb{E}(r_{L})$.

{E(r_{L})} & & {100\%} & {78.97\%} \\
\hline
\end{array}
}
$$

Note that the obtained values of optimal relativities may not be desirable for
commercial implementations because of the possibility of irregular differences 
between adjacent *BMS* levels. To alleviate this problem, insurers could consider 
imposing linear optimal relativities in the form of $r_{L}^{\text{linear}}=a+bL$ 
by solving the following constrained optimization with an inequality constraint 

$$
\min\mathbb{E}\left((\Lambda\Theta-\Lambda a-\Lambda bL)^{2}\right) \text{ subject to }
a+b\mathbb{E}(L)\ge 1.
$$

We refer interested readers to @Tan16 for a discussion on how to incorporate
further commercial constraints and also on the solution to this optimization problem 
involving Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
