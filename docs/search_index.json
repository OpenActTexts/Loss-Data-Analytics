A subset of the book is available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats. The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience. What will success look like? The online text will be freely available to a worldwide audience. The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning. Moreover, a subset of the book will be available in pdf format for low-cost printing. The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience. How will the text be used? This book will be useful in actuarial curricula worldwide. It will cover the loss data learning objectives of the major actuarial organizations. Thus, it will be suitable for classroom use at universities as well as for use by independent learners seeking to pass professional actuarial examinations. Moreover, the text will also be useful for the continuing professional development of actuaries and other professionals in insurance and related financial risk management industries. Why is this good for the profession? An online text is a type of open educational resource (OER). One important benefit of an OER is that it equalizes access to knowledge, thus permitting a broader community to learn about the actuarial profession. Moreover, it has the capacity to engage viewers through active learning that deepens the learning process, producing analysts more capable of solid actuarial work. Why is this good for students and teachers and others involved in the learning process? Cost is often cited as an important factor for students and teachers in textbook selection (see a recent post on the $400 textbook). Students will also appreciate the ability to “carry the book around” on their mobile devices. Why loss data analytics? The intent is that this type of resource will eventually permeate throughout the actuarial curriculum. Given the dramatic changes in the way that actuaries treat data, loss data seems like a natural place to start. The idea behind the name loss data analytics is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools. In particular, we recognize that big data (including social media and usage based insurance) are here to stay and that high speed computation is readily available.

Data for running our examples are available at the same site. In developing this book, we are emphasizing the online version that has lots of great features such as a glossary, code and solutions to examples that you can be revealed interactively. For example, you will find that the statistical code is hidden and can only be seen by clicking on terms such as R Code for Frequency Table Insample &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Insample.csv&quot;, header=T, na.strings=c(&quot;.&quot;), stringsAsFactors=FALSE) Insample2010 &lt;- subset(Insample, Year==2010) table(Insample2010$Freq) We hide the code because we don’t want to insist that you use the R statistical software (although we like it). Still, we encourage you to try some statistical code as you read the book – we have opted to make it easy to learn R as you go. We have even set up a separate R Code for Loss Data Analytics site to explain more of the details of the code. Freely available, interactive textbooks represent a new venture in actuarial education and we need your input. Although a lot of effort has gone into the development, we expect hiccoughs. Please let your instructor know about opportunities for improvement, write us through our project site, or contact chapter contributors directly with suggested improvements. "],
["C-Intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to Loss Data Analytics 1.1 Relevance of Analytics to Insurance Activities 1.2 Insurance Company Operations 1.3 Case Study: Wisconsin Property Fund 1.4 Further Resources and Contributors", " Chapter 1 Introduction to Loss Data Analytics Chapter Preview. This book introduces readers to methods of analyzing insurance data. Section 1.1 begins with a discussion of why the use of data is important in the insurance industry. Section 1.2 gives a general overview of the purposes of analyzing insurance data which is reinforced in the Section 1.3 case study. Naturally, there is a huge gap between the broad goals summarized in the overview and a case study application; this gap is covered through the methods and techniques of data analysis covered in the rest of the text. 1.1 Relevance of Analytics to Insurance Activities In this section, you learn how to: Summarize the importance of insurance to consumers and the economy Describe analytics Identify data generating events associated with the timeline of a typical insurance contract 1.1.1 Nature and Relevance of Insurance This book introduces the process of using data to make decisions in an insurance context. It does not assume that readers are familiar with insurance but introduces insurance concepts as needed. If you are new to insurance, then it is probably easiest to think about an insurance policy that covers the contents of an apartment or house that you are renting (known as renters insuranceRenters insurance is an insurance policy that covers the contents of an apartment or house that you are renting.) or the contents and property of a building that is owned by you or a friend (known as homeowners insuranceHomeowners insurance is an insurance policy that covers the contents and property of a building that is owned by you or a friend.). Another common example is automobile insuranceAn insurance policy that covers damage to your vehicle, damage to other vehicles in the accident, as well as medical expenses of those injured in the accident.. In the event of an accident, this policy may cover damage to your vehicle, damage to other vehicles in the accident, as well as medical expenses of those injured in the accident. One way to think about the nature of insurance is who buys it. Renters, homeowners, and auto insurance are examples of personal insuranceInsurance purchased by a person in that these are policies issued to people. Businesses also buy insurance, such as coverage on their properties, and this is known as commercial insurance. The seller, an insurance company, is also known as an insurer. Even insurance companies need insurance; this is known as reinsuranceInsurance purchased by an insurer. Another way to think about the nature of insurance is the type of risk being covered. In the U.S., policies such as renters and homeowners are known as property insuranceProperty insurance is a policy that protects the insured against loss or damage to real or personal property. the cause of loss might be fire, lightening, business interruption, loss of rents, glass breakage, tornado, windstorm, hail, water damage, explosion, riot, civil commotion, rain, or damage from aircraft or vehicles. whereas a policy such as auto that covers medical damages to people is known as casualty insuranceCausalty insurance is a form of liability insurance providing coverage for negligent acts and omissions. examples include workers compensation, errors and omissions, fidelity, crime, glass, boiler, and various malpractice coverages.. In the rest of the world, these are both known as nonlife or general insurance, to distinguish them from life insuranceLife insurance is a contract where the insurer promises to pay upon the death of an insured person. the person being paid is the beneficiary. . Both life and non-life insurances are important components of the world economy. The Insurance Information Institute (2016) estimates that direct insurance premiums in the world for 2014 was 2,654,549 for life and 2,123,699 for non-life; these figures are in millions of U.S. dollars. As noted earlier, the total represents 6.2% of the world GDP. Put another way, life accounts for 55.5% of insurance premiums and 3.4% of world GDP whereas non-life accounts for 44.5% of insurance premiums and 2.8% of world GDP. Both life and non-life represent important economic activities. Insurance may not be as entertaining as the sports industry (another industry that depends heavily on data) but it does affect the financial livelihoods of many. By almost any measure, insurance is a major economic activity. On a global level, insurance premiums comprised about 6.2% of the world gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014, (Insurance Information Institute 2016). As examples, premiums accounted for 18.9% of GDP in Taiwan (the highest in the study) and represented 7.3% of GDP in the United States. On a personal level, almost everyone owning a home has insurance to protect themselves in the event of a fire, hailstorm, or some other calamitous event. Almost every country requires insurance for those driving a car. In sum, although not particularly entertaining, insurance plays an important role in the economies of nations and the lives of individuals. 1.1.2 What is Analytics? Insurance is a data-driven industry. Like all major corporations and organizations, insurers use data when trying to decide how much to pay employees, how many employees to retain, how to market their services and products, how to forecast financial trends, and so on. These represent general areas of activities that are not specific to the insurance industry. Although each industry has its own data nuances and needs, the collection, analysis and use of data is an activity shared by all, from the internet giants to the small business, by public and governmental organizations, and is not specific to the insurance industry. You will find that the data collection and analysis methods and tools introduced in this text are relevant for all. In any data-driven industry, analytics is a key to deriving and extracting information from data. But what is analytics? Making data-driven business decisions has been described as business analytics, business intelligence, and data science. These terms, among others, are sometimes used interchangeably and sometimes refer to distinct applications. Business intelligence may focus on processes of collecting data, often through databases and data warehouses, whereas business analytics utilizes tools and methods for statistical analyses of data. In contrast to these two terms that emphasize business applications, the term data science can encompass broader data related applications in many scientific domains. For our purposes, we use the term analyticsAnalytics is the process of using data to make decisions. to refer to the process of using data to make decisions. This process involves gathering data, understanding concepts and models of uncertainty, making general inferences, and communicating results. When introducing data methods in this text, we will focus on losses that arise from, or related to, obligations in insurance contracts. This could be the amount of damage to one’s apartment under a renter’s insurance agreement, the amount needed to compensate someone that you hurt in a driving accident, and the like. We call these obligations insurance claimAn insurance claim is the compensation provided by the insurer for incurred hurt, loss, or damage that is covered by the policy.. With this focus, we will be able to introduce and directly use generally applicable statistical tools and techniques. 1.1.3 Insurance Processes Yet another way to think about the nature of insurance is by the duration of an insurance contract, known as the termThe duration of an insurance contract. This text will focus on short-term insurance contracts. By short-term, we mean contracts where the insurance coverage is typically provided for a year or six months. Most commercial and personal contracts are for a year so that will be our default duration. An important exception is U.S. auto policies that are often six months in length. In contrast, we typically think of life insurance as a long-term contract where the default is to have a multi-year contract. For example, if a person 25 years old purchases a whole life policy that pays upon death of the insured and that person does not die until age 100, then the contract is in force for 75 years. There are other important differences between life and non-life products. In life insurance, the benefit amount is often stipulated in the contract provisions. In contrast, most non-life contracts provide for compensation of insured losses which are unknown before the accident. (There are usually limits placed on the compensation amounts.) In a life insurance contract that stretches over many years, the time value of money plays a prominent role. In a non-life contract, the random amount of compensation takes priority. In both life and non-life insurances, the frequency of claims is very important. For many life insurance contracts, the insured event (such as death) happens only once. In contrast, for non-life insurances such as automobile, it is common for individuals (especially young male drivers) to get into more than one accident during a year. So, our models need to reflect this observation; we will introduce different frequency models that you may also see when studying life insurance. For short-term insurance, the framework of the probabilistic model is straightforward. We think of a one-period model (the period length, e.g., one year, will be specified in the situation). At the beginning of the period, the insured pays the insurer a known premium that is agreed upon by both parties to the contract. At the end of the period, the insurer reimburses the insured for a (possibly multivariate) random loss. This framework will be developed as we proceed; but we first focus on integrating this framework with concerns about how the data may arise. From an insurer’s viewpoint, contracts may be only for a year but they tend to be renewed. Moreover, payments arising from claims during the year may extend well beyond a single year. One way to describe the data arising from operations of an insurance company is to use a timeline granular approach. A process approach provides an overall view of the events occurring during the life of an insurance contract, and their nature – random or planned, loss events (claims) and contract changes events, and so forth. In this micro oriented view, we can think about what happens to a contract at various stages of its existence. Figure 1.1 traces a timeline of a typical insurance contract. Throughout the life of the contract, the company regularly processes events such as premium collection and valuation, described in Section 1.2; these are marked with an x on the timeline. Non-regular and unanticipated events also occur. To illustrate, \\(\\mathrm{t}_2\\) and \\(\\mathrm{t}_4\\) mark the event of an insurance claim (some contracts, such as life insurance, can have only a single claim). Times \\(\\mathrm{t}_3\\) and \\(\\mathrm{t}_5\\) mark events when a policyholder wishes to alter certain contract features, such as the choice of a deductibleA deductible is a parameter specified in the contract. typically, losses below the deductible are paid by the policyholder whereas losses in excess of the deductible are the insurer’s responsibility (subject to policy limits and coninsurance). or the amount of coverage. From a company perspective, one can even think about the contract initiation (arrival, time \\(\\mathrm{t}_1\\)) and contract termination (departure, time \\(\\mathrm{t}_6\\)) as uncertain events. (Alternatively, for some purposes, you may condition on these events and treat them as certain.) Figure 1.1: Timeline of a Typical Insurance Policy. Arrows mark the occurrences of random events. Each x marks the time of scheduled events that are typically non-random. Show Quiz Solution 1.2 Insurance Company Operations In this section, you learn how to: Describe five major operational areas of insurance companies. Identify the role of data and analytics opportunities within each operational area. Armed with insurance data, the end goal is to use data to make decisions. We will learn more about methods of analyzing and extrapolating data in future chapters. To begin, let us think about why we want to do the analysis. We will take the insurance company’s viewpoint (not the insured person) and introduce ways of bringing money in, paying it out, managing costs, and making sure that we have enough money to meet obligations. The emphasis is on insurance-specific operations rather than on general business activities such as advertising, marketing, and human resources management. Specifically, in many insurance companies, it is customary to aggregate detailed insurance processes into larger operational units; many companies use these functional areas to segregate employee activities and areas of responsibilities. Actuaries, other financial analysts, and insurance regulators work within these units and use data for the following activities: Initiating Insurance. At this stage, the company makes a decision as to whether or not to take on a risk (the underwritingUnderwriting is the process where the company makes a decision as to whether or not to take on a risk. stage) and assign an appropriate premium (or rate). Insurance analytics has its actuarial roots in ratemaking, where analysts seek to determine the right price for the right risk. Renewing Insurance. Many contracts, particularly in general insurance, have relatively short durations such as 6 months or a year. Although there is an implicit expectation that such contracts will be renewed, the insurer has the opportunity to decline coverage and to adjust the premium. Analytics is also used at this policy renewal stage where the goal is to retain profitable customers. Claims Management. Analytics has long been used in (1) detecting and preventing claims fraud, (2) managing claim costs, including identifying the appropriate support for claims handling expenses, as well as (3) understanding excess layers for reinsurance and retention. Loss Reserving. Analytic tools are used to provide management with an appropriate estimate of future obligations and to quantify the uncertainty of those estimates. Solvency and Capital Allocation. Deciding on the requisite amount of capital and on ways of allocating capital among alternative investments are also important analytics activities. Companies must understand how much capital is needed so that they will have sufficient flow of cash available to meet their obligations at the times they are expected to materialize (solvency). This is an important question that concerns not only company managers but also customers, company shareholders, regulatory authorities, as well as the public at large. Related to issues of how much capital is the question of how to allocate capital to differing financial projects, typically to maximize an investor’s return. Although this question can arise at several levels, insurance companies are typically concerned with how to allocate capital to different lines of business within a firm and to different subsidiaries of a parent firm. Although data represent a critical component of solvency and capital allocation, other components including the local and global economic framework, the financial investments environment, and quite specific requirements according to the regulatory environment of the day, are also important. Because of the background needed to address these components, we will not address solvency, capital allocation, and regulation issues in this text. Nonetheless, for all operating functions, we emphasize that analytics in the insurance industry is not an exercise that a small group of analysts can do by themselves. It requires an insurer to make significant investments in their information technology, marketing, underwriting, and actuarial functions. As these areas represent the primary end goals of the analysis of data, additional background on each operational unit is provided in the following subsections. 1.2.1 Initiating Insurance Setting the price of an insurance product can be a perplexing problem. This is in contrast to other industries such as manufacturing where the cost of a product is (relatively) known and provides a benchmark for assessing a market demand price. Similarly, in other areas of financial services, market prices are available and provide the basis for a market-consistent pricing structure of products. However, for many lines of insurance, the cost of a product is uncertain and market prices are unavailable. Expectations of the random cost is a reasonable place to start for a price. (If you have studied finance, then you will recall that an expectation is the optimal price for a risk-neutral insurer.) It has been traditional in insurance pricing to begin with the expected cost. Insurers then add margins to this, to account for the product’s riskiness, expenses incurred in servicing the product, and an allowance for profit/surplus of the company. Use of expected costs as a foundation for pricing is prevalent in some lines of the insurance business. These include automobile and homeowners insurance. For these lines, analytics has served to sharpen the market by making the calculation of the product’s expected cost more precise. The increasing availability of the internet to consumers has also promoted transparency in pricing; in today’s marketplace, consumers have ready access to competing quotes from a host of insurers. Insurers seek to increase their market share by refining their risk classificationRisk classification is the process of grouping policyholders into categories, or classes, where each insured in the class has a risk profile that is similar to others in the class. systems, thus achieving a better approximation of the products’ prices and enabling cream-skimming underwriting strategies (“cream-skimming” is a phrase used when the insurer underwrites only the best risks). Recent surveys (e.g., Earnix (2013)) indicate that pricing is the most common use of analytics among insurers. Underwriting, the process of classifying risks into homogeneous categories and assigning policyholders to these categories, lies at the core of ratemaking. Policyholders within a class (category) have similar risk profiles and so are charged the same insurance price. This is the concept of an actuarially fair premium; it is fair to charge different rates to policyholders only if they can be separated by identifiable risk factors. An early article, Two Studies in Automobile Insurance Ratemaking (Bailey and LeRoy 1960), provided a catalyst to the acceptance of analytic methods in the insurance industry. This paper addresses the problem of classification ratemaking. It describes an example of automobile insurance that has five use classes cross-classified with four merit rating classes. At that time, the contribution to premiums for use and merit rating classes were determined independently of each other. Thinking about the interacting effects of different classification variables is a more difficult problem. 1.2.2 Renewing Insurance Insurance is a type of financial service and, like many service contracts, insurance coverage is often agreed upon for a limited time period at which time coverage commitments are complete. Particularly for general insurance, the need for coverage continues and so efforts are made to issue a new contract providing similar coverage, when the existing contract comes to the end of its term. This is called policy renewal. Renewal issues can also arise in life insurance, e.g., term (temporary) life insurance. At the same time other contracts, such as life annuities, terminate upon the insured’s death and so issues of renewability are irrelevant. In the absence of legal restrictions, at renewal the insurer has the opportunity to: accept or decline to underwrite the risk; and determine a new premium, possibly in conjunction with a new classification of the risk. Risk classification and rating at renewal is based on two types of information. First, at the initial stage, the insurer has available many rating variables upon which decisions can be made. Many variables will not change, e.g., sex, whereas others are likely to have changed, e.g., age, and still others may or may not change, e.g., credit score. Second, unlike the initial stage, at renewal the insurer has available a history of policyholder’s loss experience, and this history can provide insights into the policyholder that are not available from rating variables. Modifying premiums with claims history is known as experience rating, also sometimes referred to as merit rating. Experience rating methods are either applied retrospectively or prospectively. With retrospective methods, a refund of a portion of the premium is provided to the policyholder in the event of favorable (to the insurer) experience. Retrospective premiumsThe process of determining the cost of an insurance policy based on the actual loss experience determined as an adjustment to the initial premium payment. are common in life insurance arrangements (where policyholders earn dividendsA dividend is the refund of a portion of the premium paid by the insured from insurer surplus. in the U.S., bonuses in the U.K., and profit sharing in Israeli term life coverage). In general insurance, prospective methods are more common, where favorable insured experience is rewarded through a lower renewal premium. Claims history can provide information about a policyholder’s risk appetite. For example, in personal lines it is common to use a variable to indicate whether or not a claim has occurred in the last three years. As another example, in a commercial line such as worker’s compensation, one may look to a policyholder’s average claim frequency or severity over the last three years. Claims history can reveal information that is otherwise hidden (to the insurer) about the policyholder. 1.2.3 Claims and Product Management In some of areas of insurance, the process of paying claims for insured events is relatively straightforward. For example, in life insurance, a simple death certificate is all that is needed to pay the benefit amount as provided in the contract. However, in non-life areas such as property and casualty insurance, the process can be much more complex. Think about even a relatively simple insured event such as automobile accident. Here, it is often required to determine which party is at fault, one needs to assess damage to all of the vehicles and people involved in the incident, both insured and non-insured, the expenses incurred in assessing the damages must be assessed, and so forth. The process of determining coverage, legal liability, and settling claims is known as claims adjustmentClaims adjustment is the process of determining coverage, legal liability, and settling claims.. Insurance managers sometimes use the phrase claims leakageClaims leakage respresents money lost through claims management inefficiencies. to mean dollars lost through claims management inefficiencies. There are many ways in which analytics can help manage the claims process, c.f., Gorman and Swenson (2013). Historically, the most important has been fraud detection. The claim adjusting process involves reducing information asymmetry (the claimant knows what happened; the company knows some of what happened). Mitigating fraud is an important part of the claims management process. Fraud detection is only one aspect of managing claims. More broadly, one can think about claims management as consisting of the following components: Claims triaging. Just as in the medical world, early identification and appropriate handling of high cost claims (patients, in the medical world), can lead to dramatic savings. For example, in workers compensation, insurers look to achieve early identification of those claims that run the risk of high medical costs and a long payout period. Early intervention into these cases could give insurers more control over the handling of the claim, the medical treatment, and the overall costs with an earlier return-to-work. Claims processing. The goal is to use analytics to identify routine situations that are anticipated to have small payouts. More complex situations may require more experienced adjusters and legal assistance to appropriately handle claims with high potential payouts. Adjustment decisions. Once a complex claim has been identified and assigned to an adjusterAn adjuster is a person who investigates claims and recommends settlement options based on estimates of damage and insurance policies held., analytic driven routines can be established to aid subsequent decision-making processes. Such processes can also be helpful for adjusters in developing case reserves, an estimate of the insurer’s future liability. This is an important input to the insurer’s loss reserves, described in Section 1.2.4. In addition to the insured’s reimbursement for losses, the insurer also needs to be concerned with another source of revenue outflow, expenses. loss adjustment expensesLoss adjustment expenses are costs to the insurer that are directly attributable to settling a claims. for example, the cost of an adjuster is someone who assess the claim cost or a lawyer who becomes involve in settling an insurer’s legal obligation on a claim are part of an insurer’s cost of managing claims. Analytics can be used to reduce expenses directly related to claims handling (allocatedAllocated loss adjustment expenses, sometimes known by the acronym alea, are costs that can be directly attributed to settling a claim; for example, the cost of an adjuster) as well as general staff time for overseeing the claims processes (unallocatedUnallocated loss adjustment expenses are costs that can only be indirectly attributed to claim settlement; for example, the cost of an office to support claims staff). The insurance industry has high operating costs relative to other portions of the financial services sectors. In addition to claims payments, there are many other ways in which insurers use data to manage their products. We have already discussed the need for analytics in underwriting, that is, risk classification at the initial acquisition and renewal stages. Insurers are also interested in which policyholders elect to renew their contract and, as with other products, monitor customer loyalty. Analytics can also be used to manage the portfolio, or collection, of risks that an insurer has acquired. When the risk is initially obtained, the insurer’s risk can be managed by imposing contract parameters that modify contract payouts. Chapters 3 and 10 describe common modifications including coinsuranceCoinsurance is an arrangement whereby the insured and insurer share the covered losses. typically, a coinsurance parameter specified means that both parties receive a proportional share, e.g., 50%, of the loss., deductibles and policy upper limits. After the contract has been agreed upon with an insured, the insurer may still modify its net obligation by entering into a reinsurance agreement. This type of agreement is with a reinsurer, an insurer of an insurer. It is common for insurance companies to purchase insurance on its portfolio of risks to gain protection from unusual events, just as people and other companies do. 1.2.4 Loss Reserving An important feature that distinguishes insurance from other sectors of the economy is the timing of the exchange of considerations. In manufacturing, payments for goods are typically made at the time of a transaction. In contrast, for insurance, money received from a customer occurs in advance of benefits or services; these are rendered at a later date when the insured event occurs. This leads to the need to hold a reservoir of wealth to meet future obligations in respect to obligations made, and to gain the trust of the insureds that the company will be able to fulfill its commitments. The size of this reservoir of wealth, and the importance of ensuring its adequacy, is a major concern for the insurance industry. Setting aside money for unpaid claims is known as loss reservingA loss reserve is an estimate of liability indicating the amount the insurer expects to pay for claims that have not yet been realized. this includes losses incurred but not yet reported (ibnr) and those claims that have been reported claims that haven’t been paid (known by the acronym rbns for reported but not settled).; in some jurisdictions, reserves are also known as technical provisions. We saw in Figure 1.1 several times at which a company summarizes its financial position; these times are known as valuation dates. Claims that arise prior to valuation dates have typically been paid, are in the process of being paid, or are about to be paid; claims in the future of these valuation dates are unknown. A company must estimate these outstanding liabilities when determining its financial strength. Accurately determining loss reserves is important to insurers for many reasons. Loss reserves represent an anticipated claim that the insurer owes its customers. Under-reserving may result in a failure to meet claim liabilities. Conversely, an insurer with excessive reserves may present a weaker financial position than it truly has. Reserves provide an estimate for the unpaid cost of insurance that can be used for pricing contracts. Loss reserving is required by laws and regulations. The public has a strong interest in the financial strength and solvency of insurers. In addition to insurance company management and regulators, other stakeholders such as investors and customers make decisions that depend on company loss reserves. Loss reserving is a topic where there are substantive differences between life and general (also known as property and casualty, or non-life), insurance. In life insurance, the severity (amount of loss) is often not a source of uncertainty as payouts are specified in the contract. The frequency, driven by mortality of the insured, is a concern. However, because of the length of time for settlement of life insurance contracts, the time value of money uncertainty as measured from issue to date of payment can dominate frequency concerns. For example, for an insured who purchases a life contract at age 20, it would not be unusual for the contract to still be open in 60 years time, when the insured celebrates his or her 80th birthday. See, for example, Bowers et al. (1986) or Dickson, Hardy, and Waters (2013) for introductions to reserving for life insurance. Show Quiz Solution 1.3 Case Study: Wisconsin Property Fund In this section, we use the Wisconsin Property Fund as a case study. You learn how to: Describe how data generating events can produce data of interest to insurance analysts. Produce relevant summary statistics for each variable. Describe how these summary statistics can be used in each of the major operational areas of an insurance company. Let us illustrate the kind of data under consideration and the goals that we wish to achieve by examining the Local Government Property Insurance Fund (LGPIF), an insurance pool administered by the Wisconsin Office of the Insurance Commissioner. The LGPIF was established to provide property insurance for local government entities that include counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, and library boards. The fund insures local government property such as government buildings, schools, libraries, and motor vehicles. The fund covers all property losses except those resulting from flood, earthquake, wear and tear, extremes in temperature, mold, war, nuclear reactions, and embezzlement or theft by an employee. The fund covers over a thousand local government entities who pay approximately \\$25 million in premiums each year and receive insurance coverage of about \\$75 billion. State government buildings are not covered; the LGPIF is for local government entities that have separate budgetary responsibilities and who need insurance to moderate the budget effects of uncertain insurable events. Coverage for local government property has been made available by the State of Wisconsin since 1911, thus providing a wealth of historical data. In this illustration, we restrict consideration to claims from coverage of building and contents; we do not consider claims from motor vehicles and specialized equipment owned by local entities (such as snow plowing machines). We also consider only claims that are closed, with obligations fully met. 1.3.1 Fund Claims Variables: Frequency and Severity At a fundamental level, insurance companies accept premiums in exchange for promises to compensate a policyholder upon the occurrence of an insured event. IndemnificationIndemnification is the compensation provided by the insurer. is the compensation provided by the insurer for incurred hurt, loss, or damage that is covered by the policy. This compensation is also known as a claim. The extent of the payout, known as the severity, is a key financial expenditure for an insurer. In terms of money outgo, an insurer is indifferent to having ten claims of 100 when compared to one claim of 1,000. Nonetheless, it is common for insurers to study how often claims arise, known as the frequency of claims. The frequency is important for expenses, but it also influences contractual parameters (such as deductibles and policy limits that are described later) that are written on a per occurrence basis, is routinely monitored by insurance regulators, and can be a key driver in the overall indemnification obligation of the insurer. We shall consider the frequency and severity as the two main claim variables that we wish to understand, model, and manage. To illustrate, in 2010 there were 1,110 policyholders in the property fund who experienced a total of 1,377 claims. Table 1.1 shows the distribution. Almost two-thirds (0.637) of the policyholders did not have any claims and an additional 18.8% had only one claim. The remaining 17.5% (=1 - 0.637 - 0.188) had more than one claim; the policyholder with the highest number recorded 239 claims. The average number of claims for this sample was 1.24 (=1377/1110). Table 1.1: 2010 Claims Frequency Distribution Type Number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or more Sum Count 707 209 86 40 18 12 9 4 6 19 1,110 Claims 0 209 172 120 72 60 54 28 48 617 1,377 Proportion 0.637 0.188 0.077 0.036 0.016 0.011 0.008 0.004 0.005 0.017 1.000 R Code for Frequency Table Insample &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Insample.csv&quot;, header=T, na.strings=c(&quot;.&quot;), stringsAsFactors=FALSE) Insample2010 &lt;- subset(Insample, Year==2010) table(Insample2010$Freq) For the severity distribution, a common approach is to examine the distribution of the sample of 1,377 claims. However, another common approach is to examine the distribution of the average claims of those policyholders with claims. In our 2010 sample, there were 403 (=1110-707) such policyholders. For 209 of these policyholders with one claim, the average claim equals the only claim they experienced. For the policyholder with highest frequency, the average claim is an average over 239 separately reported claim events. This average is also known as the pure premiumPure premium is the total severity divided by the number of claims. it does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. also called loss costs. some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae). or loss cost. Table 1.2 summarizes the sample distribution of average severities from the 403 policyholders who made a claim; it shows that the average claim amount was 56,330 (all amounts are in U.S. Dollars). However, the average gives only a limited look at the distribution. More information can be gleaned from the summary statistics which show a very large claim in the amount of 12,920,000. Figure 1.2 provides further information about the distribution of sample claims, showing a distribution that is dominated by this single large claim so that the histogram is not very helpful. Even when removing the large claim, you will find a distribution that is skewed to the right. A generally accepted technique is to work with claims in logarithmic units especially for graphical purposes; the corresponding figure in the right-hand panel is much easier to interpret.

However, when actuaries and other financial analysts use those models, they do so in the context of external variables. In general statistical terminology, one might call these explanatory or predictor variables; there are many other names in statistics, economics, psychology, and other disciplines. Because of our insurance focus, we call them rating variablesRating variables are the components of an insurance pricing formula. they can include numeric variables (like values, revenue, or area) and classification variables (like location, type of vehicle, or type of occupancy.) as they will be useful in setting insurance rates and premiums. We earlier considered observations from a sample of 1,110 policyholders which may seem like a lot. However, as we will see in our forthcoming applications, because of the preponderance of zeros and the skewed nature of claims, actuaries typically yearn for more data. One common approach that we adopt here is to examine outcomes from multiple years, thus increasing the sample size. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of this strategy later but, at this juncture, we just wish to show the reader how it works. Specifically, Table 1.3 shows that we now consider policies over five years of data, 2006, …, 2010, inclusive. The data begins in 2006 because there was a shift in claim coding in 2005 so that comparisons with earlier years are not helpful. To mitigate the effect of open claims, we consider policy years prior to 2011. An open claim means that not all of the obligations for the claim are known at the time of the analysis; for some claims, such an injury to a person in an auto accident or in the workplace, it can take years before costs are fully known. Table 1.3: Claims Summary by Policyholder Year Average Frequency Average Severity Average Coverage Number of Policyholders 2006 0.951 9,695 32,498,186 1,154 2007 1.167 6,544 35,275,949 1,138 2008 0.974 5,311 37,267,485 1,125 2009 1.219 4,572 40,355,382 1,112 2010 1.241 20,452 41,242,070 1,110 R Code for Claims Summary by Policyholder Insample &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/PropertyFundInsample.csv&quot;, header=T, na.strings=c(&quot;.&quot;), stringsAsFactors=FALSE) library(doBy) T1A &lt;- summaryBy(Freq ~ Year, data = Insample, FUN = function(x) { c(m = mean(x), num=length(x)) } ) T1B &lt;- summaryBy(yAvg ~ Year, data = Insample, FUN = function(x) { c(m = mean(x), num=length(x)) } ) T1C &lt;- summaryBy(BCcov ~ Year, data = Insample, FUN = function(x) { c(m = mean(x), num=length(x)) } ) Table1In &lt;- cbind(T1A[1],T1A[2],T1B[2],T1C[2],T1A[3]) names(Table1In) &lt;- c(&quot;Year&quot;, &quot;Average Frequency&quot;,&quot;Average Severity&quot;, &quot;Average&quot;,&quot;Number of Policyholders&quot;) Table1In Table 1.3 shows that the average claim varies over time, especially with the high 2010 value (that we saw was due to a single large claim)1. The total number of policyholders is steadily declining and, conversely, the coverage is steadily increasing. The coverage variable is the amount of coverage of the property and contents. Roughly, you can think of it as the maximum possible payout of the insurer. For our immediate purposes, the coverage is our first rating variable. Other things being equal, we would expect that policyholders with larger coverage will have larger claims. We will make this vague idea much more precise as we proceed, and also justify this expectation with data. For a different look at the 2006-2010 data, Table 1.4 summarizes the distribution of our two outcomes, frequency and claims amount. In each case, the average exceeds the median, suggesting that the two distributions are right-skewed. In addition, the table summarizes our continuous rating variables, coverage and deductible amount. The table also suggests that these variables also have right-skewed distributions.

Hopefully, these are variables that you think might naturally be related to claims outcomes. You can learn more about them in Frees, Lee, and Yang (2016). To handle the skewness, we henceforth focus on logarithmic transformations of coverage and deductibles. Description of Rating Variables \\[{\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ l | l} \\hline Variable &amp; Description \\\\ \\hline \\text{EntityType} &amp; \\text{Categorical variable that is one of six types: (Village, City,} \\\\ &amp; ~~~~ \\text{County, Misc, School, or Town)} \\\\ \\text{LnCoverage} &amp; \\text{Total building and content coverage, in logarithmic millions of dollars}\\\\ \\text{LnDeduct} &amp; \\text{Deductible, in logarithmic dollars} \\\\ \\text{AlarmCredit} &amp; \\text{Categorical variable that is one of four types: (0, 5, 10, or 15)} \\\\ &amp; ~~~~ \\text{for automatic smoke alarms in main rooms} \\\\ \\text{NoClaimCredit} &amp; \\text{Binary variable to indicate no claims in the past two years} \\\\ \\text{Fire5 } &amp; \\text{Binary variable to indicate the fire class is below 5} \\\\ &amp; ~~~~ \\text{(The range of fire class is 0 to 10)} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}}\\] To get a sense of the relationship between the non-continuous rating variables and claims, Table 1.5 relates the claims outcomes to these categorical variables. Table 1.5 suggests substantial variation in the claim frequency and average severity of the claims by entity type. It also demonstrates higher frequency and severity for the \\({\\tt Fire5}\\) variable and the reverse for the \\({\\tt NoClaimCredit}\\) variable. The relationship for the \\({\\tt Fire5}\\) variable is counter-intuitive in that one would expect lower claim amounts for those policyholders in areas with better public protection (when the protection code is five or less). Naturally, there are other variables that influence this relationship. We will see that these background variables are accounted for in the subsequent multivariate regression analysis, which yields an intuitive, appealing (negative) sign for the \\({\\tt Fire5}\\) variable.

It underscores the difficulty of examining variables individually. For example, when looking at the experience for all entities, we see that policyholders with no alarm credit have on average lower frequency and severity than policyholders with the highest (15%, with 24/7 monitoring by a fire station or security company) alarm credit. In particular, when we look at the entity type School, the frequency is 0.422 and the severity 25,523 for no alarm credit, whereas for the highest alarm level it is 2.008 and 85,140. This may simply imply that entities with more claims are the ones that are likely to have an alarm system. Summary tables do not examine multivariate effects; for example, Table 1.5 ignores the effect of size (as we measure through coverage amounts) that affect claims.

We have also introduced a continuous rating variable (coverage); a discrete quantitative variable (logarithmic deductibles); two binary rating variables (no claims credit and fire class); and two categorical rating variables (entity type and alarm credit). Subsequent chapters will explain how to analyze and model the distribution of these variables and their relationships. Before getting into these technical details, let us first think about where we want to go. General insurance company functional areas are described in Section 1.2; let us now think about how these areas might apply in the context of the property fund. Initiating Insurance Because this is a government sponsored fund, we do not have to worry about selecting good or avoiding poor risks; the fund is not allowed to deny a coverage application from a qualified local government entity. If we do not have to underwrite, what about how much to charge? We might look at the most recent experience in 2010, where the total fund claims were approximately 28.16 million USD (\\(=1377 \\text{ claims} \\times 20452 \\text{ average severity}\\)). Dividing that among 1,110 policyholders, that suggests a rate of 24,370 ( \\(\\approx\\) 28,160,000/1110). However, 2010 was a bad year; using the same method, our premium would be much lower based on 2009 data. This swing in premiums would defeat the primary purpose of the fund, to allow for a steady charge that local property managers could utilize in their budgets. Having a single price for all policyholders is nice but hardly seems fair. For example, Table 1.5 suggests that Schools have much higher claims than other entities and so should pay more. However, simply doing the calculation on an entity by entity basis is not right either. For example, we saw in Table 1.6 that had we used this strategy, entities with a 15% alarm credit (for good behavior, having top alarm systems) would actually wind up paying more. So, we have the data for thinking about the appropriate rates to charge but will need to dig deeper into the analysis. We will explore this topic further in Chapter 7 on premium calculation fundamentals. Selecting appropriate risks is introduced in Chapter 8 on risk classification. Renewing Insurance Although property insurance is typically a one-year contract, Table 1.3 suggests that policyholders tend to renew; this is typical of general insurance. For renewing policyholders, in addition to their rating variables we have their claims history and this claims history can be a good predictor of future claims. For example, Table 1.5 shows that policyholders without a claim in the last two years had much lower claim frequencies than those with at least one accident (0.310 compared to 1.501); a lower predicted frequency typically results in a lower premium. This is why it is common for insurers to use variables such as \\({\\tt NoClaimCredit}\\) in their rating. We will explore this topic further in Chapter 9 on experience rating. Claims Management Of course, the main story line of the 2010 experience was the large claim of over 12 million USD, nearly half the claims for that year. Are there ways that this could have been prevented or mitigated? Are their ways for the fund to purchase protection against such large unusual events? Another unusual feature of the 2010 experience noted earlier was the very large frequency of claims (239) for one policyholder. Given that there were only 1,377 claims that year, this means that a single policyholder had 17.4 % of the claims. This also suggests opportunities for managing claims, the subject of Chapter 10. Loss Reserving In our case study, we look only at the one year outcomes of closed claims (the opposite of open). However, like many lines of insurance, obligations from insured events to buildings such as fire, hail, and the like, are not known immediately and may develop over time. Other lines of business, including those where there are injuries to people, take much longer to develop. Chapter 11 introduces this concern and loss reserving, the discipline of determining how much the insurance company should retain to meet its obligations.

A primary focus for insurers is estimating the magnitude of aggregate claims it must bear under its insurance contracts. Aggregate claimsThe sum of all claims observed in a period of time are affected by both the frequency of insured events and the severity of the insured event. Decomposing aggregate claims into these two components, each of which warrant significant attention, is essential for analysis and pricing. This chapter discusses frequency distributions, summary measures, and parameter estimation techniques. In Section 2.1, we present terminology and discuss reasons why we study frequency and severity separately. The foundations of frequency distributions and measures are presented in Section 2.2 along with three principal distributions: the binomial, the Poisson, and the negative binomial. These three distributions are members of what is known as the (a,b,0) class of distributions, a distinguishing, identifying feature which allows for efficient calculation of probabilities, further discussed in Section 2.3. When fitting a dataset with a distribution, parameter values need to be estimated and in Section 2.4, the procedure for maximum likelihood estimation is explained. For insurance datasets, the observation at 0, denoting the occurrence of zero of a particular event, is notable and may deserve additional attention. By nature of the dataset, and explained further in Section 2.5, it may be impossible to have zero of the studied event, or the probability at zero could be of such a magnitude that direct fitting would lead to improper estimates. Zero truncation or modification techniques allow for more appropriate distribution fit. Noting that our insurance portfolio could consist of different sub-groups, each with its own set of individual characteristics, Section 2.6 introduces mixture distributions and methodology to allow for this heterogeneity within a portfolio. Section 2.7 describes Goodness of Fit which measures the reasonableness of the parameter estimates. Exercises are presented in Section 2.8 and Section 2.9.1 concludes the chapter with R Code for plots depicted in Section 2.4. 2.1 Frequency Distributions In this section, you learn how to summarize the importance of frequency modeling in terms of contractual, behavioral, database and regulatory/administrative motivations. 2.1.1 How Frequency Augments Severity Information 2.1.1.1 Basic Terminology In this chapter, loss, also referred to as ground-up loss, denotes the amount suffered by the insured. We use claim to denote the indemnification upon the occurrence of an insured event, thus the amount paid by the insurer. While some texts use loss and claim interchangeably, we wish to make a distinction here to recognize how insurance contractual provisions, such as deductibles and limits, affect the size of the claim stemming from a loss. FrequencyCount random variables that represent the number of claims represents how often an insured event occurs, typically within a policy contract. Here, we focus on count random variables that represent the number of claims, that is, how frequently an event occurs. SeverityThe amount, or size, of each payment for an insured event denotes the amount, or size, of each payment for an insured event. In future chapters, the aggregate model, which combines frequency models with severity models, is examined. 2.1.1.2 The Importance of Frequency Recall from Chapter 1 that setting the price of an insurance good can be a complex problem. In manufacturing, the cost of a good is (relatively) known. In other financial service areas, market prices are available. In insurance, we can generalize the price setting as follows: start with an expected cost. Add “margins” to account for the product’s riskiness, expenses incurred in servicing the product, and a profit/surplus allowance for the insurer. That expected cost for insurance can be defined as the expected number of claims times the expected amount per claim, that is, expected frequency times severity. The focus on claim count allows the insurer to consider those factors which directly affect the occurrence of a loss, thereby potentially generating a claim. The frequency process can then be modeled. 2.1.1.3 Why Examine Frequency Information Insurers and other stakeholders, including governmental organizations, have various motivations for gathering and maintaining frequency datasets. Contractual. In insurance contracts, it is common for particular deductibles and policy limits to be listed and invoked for each occurrence of an insured event. Correspondingly, the claim count data generated would indicate the number of claims which meet these criteria, offering a unique claim frequency measure. Extending this, models of total insured losses would need to account for deductibles and policy limits for each insured event. Behaviorial. In considering factors that influence loss frequency, the risk-taking and risk-reducing behavior of individuals and companies should be considered. Explanatory (rating) variables can have different effects on models of how often an event occurs in contrast to the size of the event. In healthcare, the decision to utilize healthcare by individuals, and minimize such healthcare utilization through preventive care and wellness measures, is related primarily to his or her personal characteristics. The cost per user is determined by those personal, the medical condition, potential treatment measures, and decisions made by the healthcare provider (such as the physician) and the patient. While there is overlap in those factors and how they affect total healthcare costs, attention can be focused on those separate drivers of healthcare visit frequency and healthcare cost severity. In personal lines, prior claims history is an important underwriting factor. It is common to use an indicator of whether or not the insured had a claim within a certain time period prior to the contract. Also, the number of claims incurred by the insured in previous periods has predictive power. In homeowners insurance, in modeling potential loss frequency, the insurer could consider loss prevention measures that the homeowner has adopted, such as visible security systems. Separately, when modeling loss severity, the insurer would examine those factors that affect repair and replacement costs. Databases. Insurers may hold separate data files that suggest developing separate frequency and severity models. For example, a policyholder file is established when a policy is written. This file records much underwriting information about the insured(s), such as age, gender, and prior claims experience, policy information such as coverage, deductibles and limitations, as well as the insurance claims event. A separate file, known as the “claims” file, records details of the claim against the insurer, including the amount. (There may also be a “payments” file that records the timing of the payments although we shall not deal with that here.) This recording process could then extend to insurers modeling the frequency and severity as separate processes. Regulatory and Administrative. Insurance is a highly regulated and monitored industry, given its importance in providing financial security to individuals and companies facing risk. As part of its duties, regulators routinely require the reporting of claims numbers as well as amounts. This may be due to the fact that there can be alternative definitions of an “amount,” e.g., paid versus incurred, and there is less potential error when reporting claim numbers. This continual monitoring helps ensure financial stability of these insurance companies. Show Quiz Solution 2.2 Basic Frequency Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Determine quantities that summarize a distribution such as the distribution and survival function, as well as moments such as the mean and variance Define and compute the moment and probability generating functions Describe and understand relationships among three important frequency distributions, the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions In this section, we will introduce the distributions that are commonly used in actuarial practice to model count data. The claim count random variable is denoted by \\(N\\); by its very nature it assumes only non-negative integer values. Hence the distributions below are all discrete distributions supported on the set of non-negative integers \\(\\{0, 1, \\ldots \\}\\). 2.2.1 Foundations Since \\(N\\) is a discrete random variable taking values in \\(\\{0, 1, \\ldots \\}\\), the most natural full description of its distribution is through the specification of the probabilities with which it assumes each of the non-negative integer values. This leads us to the concept of the probability mass function (pmf)A function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value of \\(N\\), denoted as \\(p_N(\\cdot)\\) and defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} p_N(k)=\\Pr(N=k), \\quad \\hbox{for } k=0,1,\\ldots \\end{equation}\\] We note that there are alternate complete descriptions, or characterizations, of the distribution of \\(N\\); for example, the distribution functionThe chance that the random variable is less than or equal to x, as a function of x of \\(N\\) denoted by \\(F_N(\\cdot)\\) and defined below is another such: \\[\\begin{equation} F_N(x):=\\begin{cases} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor } \\Pr(N=k), &amp;x\\geq 0;\\\\ 0, &amp; \\hbox{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] In the above, \\(\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor\\) denotes the floor function; \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). We note that the survival functionThe probability that the random variable takes on a value greater than a number x of \\(N\\), denoted by \\(S_N(\\cdot)\\), is defined as the ones’-complement of \\(F_N(\\cdot)\\), i.e. \\(S_N(\\cdot):=1-F_N(\\cdot)\\). Clearly, the latter is another characterization of the distribution of \\(N\\). Often one is interested in quantifying a certain aspect of the distribution and not in its complete description. This is particularly useful when comparing distributions. A center of location of the distribution is one such aspect, and there are many different measures that are commonly used to quantify it. Of these, the meanAverage is the most popular; the mean of \\(N\\), denoted by \\(\\mu_N\\),2 is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu_N=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k~p_N(k). \\end{equation}\\] We note that \\(\\mu_N\\) is the expected value of the random variable \\(N\\), i.e. \\(\\mu_N=\\mathrm{E}[N]\\). This leads to a general class of measures, the momentsThe rth moment of a list is the average value of the random variable raised to the rth power of the distribution; the \\(r\\)-th moment of \\(N\\), for \\(r&gt; 0\\), is defined as \\(\\mathrm{E}{[N^r]}\\) and denoted by \\(\\mu_N&#39;(r)\\). Hence, for \\(r&gt;0\\), we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu_N&#39;(r)= \\mathrm{E}{[N^r]}= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k^r~p_N(k). \\end{equation}\\] We note that \\(\\mu_N&#39;(\\cdot)\\) is a well-defined non-decreasing function taking values in \\([0,\\infty]\\), as \\(\\Pr(N\\in\\{0, 1, \\ldots \\})=1\\); also, note that \\(\\mu_N=\\mu_N&#39;(1)\\). In the following, when we refer to a moment it will be implicit that it is finite unless mentioned otherwise. Another basic aspect of a distribution is its dispersion, and of the various measures of dispersion studied in the literature, the standard deviationThe square-root of variance is the most popular. Towards defining it, we first define the varianceSecond central moment of a random variable x, measuring the expected squared deviation of between the variable and its mean of \\(N\\), denoted by \\(\\mathrm{Var}[N]\\), as \\(\\mathrm{Var}[N]:=\\mathrm{E}{[(N-\\mu_N)^2]}\\) when \\(\\mu_N\\) is finite. By basic properties of the expected value of a random variable, we see that \\(\\mathrm{Var}[N]:=\\mathrm{E}[N^2]-[\\mathrm{E}(N)]^2\\). The standard deviation of \\(N\\), denoted by \\(\\sigma_N\\), is defined as the square-root of \\(\\mathrm{Var}~N\\). Note that the latter is well-defined as \\(\\mathrm{Var}[N]\\), by its definition as the average squared deviation from the mean, is non-negative; \\(\\mathrm{Var}[N]\\) is denoted by \\(\\sigma_N^2\\). Note that these two measures take values in \\([0,\\infty]\\). 2.2.2 Moment and Probability Generating Functions Now we will introduce two generating functions that are found to be useful when working with count variables. Recall that for a discrete random variable, the moment generating function (mgf)The mgf of random variable n is defined the expectation of exp(tn), as a function of t of \\(N\\), denoted as \\(M_N(\\cdot)\\), is defined as \\[ M_N(t) = \\mathrm{E}~{[e^{tN}]} = \\sum^{\\infty}_{k=0} ~e^{tk}~ p_N(k), \\quad t\\in \\mathbb{R}. \\] We note that while \\(M_N(\\cdot)\\) is well defined as it is the expectation of a non-negative random variable (\\(e^{tN}\\)), though it can assume the value \\(\\infty\\). Note that for a count random variable, \\(M_N(\\cdot)\\) is finite valued on \\((-\\infty,0]\\) with \\(M_N(0)=1\\). The following theorem, whose proof can be found in (Billingsley 2008) (pages 285-6), encapsulates the reason for its name. Theorem 2.1 Let \\(N\\) be a count random variable such that \\(\\mathrm{E}~{[e^{t^\\ast N}]}\\) is finite for some \\(t^\\ast&gt;0\\). We have the following: All moments of \\(N\\) are finite, i.e. \\[ \\mathrm{E}{[N^r]}&lt;\\infty, \\quad r &gt; 0. \\] The mgf can be used to generate its moments as follows: \\[ \\left.\\frac{{\\rm d}^m}{{\\rm d}t^m} M_N(t)\\right\\vert_{t=0}=\\mathrm{E}{N^m}, \\quad m\\geq 1. \\] The mgf \\(M_N(\\cdot)\\) characterizes the distribution; in other words it uniquely specifies the distribution. Another reason that the mgf is very useful as a tool is that for two independent random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), with their mgfs existing in a neighborhood of \\(0\\), the mgf of \\(X+Y\\) is the product of their respective mgfs. A related generating function to the mgf is called the probability generating function (pgf)For a random variable n, its pgf is defined as the expectation of s^n, as a function of s, and is a useful tool for random variables taking values in the non-negative integers. For a random variable \\(N\\), by \\(P_N(\\cdot)\\) we denote its pgf and we define it as follows3: \\[\\begin{equation} P_N(s):=\\mathrm{E}~{[s^N]}, \\quad s\\geq 0. \\end{equation}\\] It is straightforward to see that if the mgf \\(M_N(\\cdot)\\) exists on \\((-\\infty,t^\\ast)\\) then \\[ P_N(s)=M_N(\\log(s)), \\quad s&lt;e^{t^\\ast}. \\] Moreover, if the pgf exists on an interval \\([0,s^\\ast)\\) with \\(s^\\ast&gt;1\\), then the mgf \\(M_N(\\cdot)\\) exists on \\((-\\infty,\\log(s^\\ast))\\), and hence uniquely specifies the distribution of \\(N\\) by Theorem 2.1. The following result for pgf is an analog of Theorem 2.1, and in particular justifies its name. Theorem 2.2 Let \\(N\\) be a count random variable such that \\(\\mathrm{E}~{(s^{\\ast})^N}\\) is finite for some \\(s^\\ast&gt;1\\). We have the following: All moments of \\(N\\) are finite, i.e. \\[ \\mathrm{E}~{N^r}&lt;\\infty, \\quad r\\geq 0. \\] The r Gloss('pmf') of \\(N\\) can be derived from the pgf as follows: \\[ p_N(m)=\\begin{cases} P_N(0), &amp;m=0;\\cr &amp;\\cr \\left(\\frac{1}{m!}\\right) \\left.\\frac{{\\rm d}^m}{{\\rm d}s^m} P_N(s)\\right\\vert_{s=0}\\;, &amp;m\\geq 1.\\cr \\end{cases} \\] The factorial moments of \\(N\\) can be derived as follows: \\[ \\left.\\frac{{\\rm d}^m}{{\\rm d}s^m} P_N(s)\\right\\vert_{s=1}=\\mathrm{E}~{\\prod\\limits_{i=0}^{m-1} (N-i)}, \\quad m\\geq 1. \\] The pgf \\(P_N(\\cdot)\\) characterizes the distribution; in other words it uniquely specifies the distribution. 2.2.3 Important Frequency Distributions In this sub-section we will study three important frequency distributions used in statistics, namely the binomial, the Poisson, and the negative binomial distributions. In the following, a risk denotes a unit covered by insurance. A risk could be an individual, a building, a company, or some other identifier for which insurance coverage is provided. For context, imagine an insurance data set containing the number of claims by risk or stratified in some other manner. The above mentioned distributions also happen to be the most commonly used in insurance practice for reasons, some of which we mention below. These distributions can be motivated by natural random experiments which are good approximations to real life processes from which many insurance data arise. Hence, not surprisingly, they together offer a reasonable fit to many insurance data sets of interest. The appropriateness of a particular distribution for the set of data can be determined using standard statistical methodologies, as we discuss later in this chapter. They provide a rich enough basis for generating other distributions that even better approximate or well cater to more real situations of interest to us. The three distributions are either one-parameter or two-parameter distributions. In fitting to data, a parameter is assigned a particular value. The set of these distributions can be enlarged to their convex hullsThe convex hull of a set of points x is the smallest convex set that contains x by treating the parameter(s) as a random variable (or vector) with its own probability distribution, with this larger set of distributions offering greater flexibility. A simple example that is better addressed by such an enlargement is a portfolio of claims generated by insureds belonging to many different risk classesThe formation of different premiums for the same coverage based on each homogeneous group’s characteristics.. In insurance data, we may observe either a marginal or inordinate number of zeros, that is, zero claims by risk. When fitting to the data, a frequency distribution in its standard specification often fails to reasonably account for this occurrence. The natural modification of the above three distributions, however, accommodate this phenomenon well towards offering a better fit. In insurance we are interested in total claims paid, whose distribution results from compounding the fitted frequency distribution with a severity distribution. These three distributions have properties that make it easy to work with the resulting aggregate severity distribution. 2.2.3.1 Binomial Distribution We begin with the binomial distribution which arises from any finite sequence of identical and independent experiments with binary outcomesOutcomes whose unit can take on only two possible states, traditionally labeled as 0 and 1. The most canonical of such experiments is the (biased or unbiased) coin tossing experiment with the outcome being heads or tails. So if \\(N\\) denotes the number of heads in a sequence of \\(m\\) independent coin tossing experiments with an identical coin which turns heads up with probability \\(q\\), then the distribution of \\(N\\) is called the binomial distributionA random variable has a binomial distribution (with parameters m and q) if it is the number of “successes” in a fixed number m of independent random trials, all of which have the same probability q of resulting in “success.” with parameters \\((m,q)\\), with \\(m\\) a positive integer and \\(q\\in[0,1]\\). Note that when \\(q=0\\) (resp., \\(q=1\\)) then the distribution is degenerate with \\(N=0\\) (resp., \\(N=m\\)) with probability \\(1\\). Clearly, its support when \\(q\\in(0,1)\\) equals \\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,m\\}\\) with pmf given by4 \\[\\begin{equation*} p_k:= \\binom{m}{k} q^k (1-q)^{m-k}, \\quad k=0,\\ldots,m. \\end{equation*}\\] where \\[\\binom{m}{k} = \\frac{m!}{k!(m-k)!}\\] The reason for its name is that the pmf takes values among the terms that arise from the binomial expansion of \\((q +(1-q))^m\\). This realization then leads to the the following expression for the pgf of the binomial distribution: \\[ P_N(z):= \\sum_{k=0}^m z^k \\binom{m}{k} q^k (1-q)^{m-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^m \\binom{m}{k} (zq)^k (1-q)^{m-k} = (qz+(1-q))^m = (1+q(z-1))^m. \\] Note that the above expression for the pgf confirms the fact that the binomial distribution is the m-convolutionThe addition of m independent random variables of the Bernoulli distribution, which is the binomial distribution with \\(m=1\\) and pgf \\((1+q(z-1))\\). Also, note that the mgf of the binomial distribution is given by \\((1+q(e^t-1))^m\\). The central moments of the binomial distribution can be found in a few different ways. To emphasize the key property that it is a \\(m\\)-convolution of the Bernoulli distribution, we derive below the moments using this property. We begin by observing that the Bernoulli distribution with parameter \\(q\\) assigns probability of \\(q\\) and \\(1-q\\) to \\(1\\) and \\(0\\), respectively. So its mean equals \\(q\\) (\\(=0\\times (1-q) + 1\\times q\\)); note that its raw second moment equals its mean as \\(N^2=N\\) with probability \\(1\\). Using these two facts we see that the variance equals \\(q(1-q)\\). Moving on to the binomial distribution with parameters \\(m\\) and \\(q\\), using the fact that it is the \\(m\\)-convolution of the Bernoulli distribution, we write \\(N\\) as the sum of \\(N_1,\\ldots,N_m\\), where \\(N_i\\) are iidIndependent and identically distributed Bernoulli variates. Now using the moments of Bernoulli and linearity of the expectation, we see that \\[ \\mathrm{E}[{N}]=\\mathrm{E}[{\\sum_{i=1}^m N_i}] = \\sum_{i=1}^m ~\\mathrm{E}[N_i] = mq. \\] Also, using the fact that the variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances, we see that \\[ \\mathrm{Var}[{N}]=\\mathrm{Var}~\\left({\\sum_{i=1}^m N_i}\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathrm{Var}[{N_i}] = mq(1-q). \\] Alternate derivations of the above moments are suggested in the exercises. One important observation, especially from the point of view of applications, is that the mean is greater than the variance unless \\(q=0\\). 2.2.3.2 Poisson Distribution After the binomial distribution, the Poisson distributionA discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event (named after the French polymath Simeon Denis Poisson) is probably the most well known of discrete distributions. This is partly due to the fact that it arises naturally as the distribution of the count of the random occurrences of a type of event in a certain time period, if the rate of occurrences of such events is a constant. It also arises as the asymptotic limit of the binomial distribution with \\(m\\rightarrow \\infty\\) and \\(mq\\rightarrow \\lambda\\). The Poisson distribution is parametrized by a single parameter usually denoted by \\(\\lambda\\) which takes values in \\((0,\\infty)\\). Its pmf is given by \\[ p_k = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!}, k=0,1,\\ldots \\] It is easy to check that the above specifies a pmf as the terms are clearly non-negative, and that they sum to one follows from the infinite Taylor series expansion of \\(e^\\lambda\\). More generally, we can derive its pgf, \\(P(\\cdot)\\), as follows: \\[ P_N(z)= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty p_k z^k = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^kz^k}{k!} = e^{-\\lambda} e^{\\lambda z} = e^{\\lambda(z-1)}, \\forall z\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\] From the above, we derive its mgf as follows: \\[ M_N(t)=P_N(e^t)=e^{\\lambda(e^t-1)}, t\\in \\mathbb{R}. \\] Towards deriving its mean, we note that for the Poisson distribution \\[ kp_k=\\begin{cases} 0, &amp;k=0;\\cr \\lambda~p_{k-1}, &amp;k\\geq1. \\end{cases} \\] this can be checked easily. In particular, this implies that \\[ \\mathrm{E}[{N}]=\\sum_{k\\geq 0} k~p_k =\\lambda\\sum_{k\\geq 1} p_{k-1} = \\lambda\\sum_{j\\geq 0} p_{j} =\\lambda. \\] In fact, more generally, using either a generalization of the above or using Theorem 2.2, we see that \\[ \\mathrm{E}{\\prod\\limits_{i=0}^{m-1} (N-i)}=\\left.\\frac{{\\rm d}^m}{{\\rm d}s^m} P_N(s)\\right\\vert_{s=1}=\\lambda^m, \\quad m\\geq 1. \\] This, in particular, implies that \\[ \\mathrm{Var}[{N}]=\\mathrm{E}[{N^2}]-[\\mathrm{E}({N})]^2 = \\mathrm{E}~[N(N-1)]+\\mathrm{E}[N]-(\\mathrm{E}[{N]})^2=\\lambda^2+\\lambda-\\lambda^2=\\lambda. \\] Note that interestingly for the Poisson distribution \\(\\mathrm{Var}[N]=\\mathrm{E}[N]\\). 2.2.3.3 Negative Binomial Distribution The third important count distribution is the negative binomial distributionThe number of successes until we observe the rth failure in independent repetitions of an experiment with binary outcomes. Recall that the binomial distribution arose as the distribution of the number of successes in \\(m\\) independent repetition of an experiment with binary outcomes. If we instead consider the number of successes until we observe the \\(r\\)-th failure in independent repetitions of an experiment with binary outcomes, then its distribution is a negative binomial distribution. A particular case, when \\(r=1\\), is the geometric distribution. However when \\(r\\) in not an integer, the above random experiment would not be applicable. In the following, we will allow the parameter \\(r\\) to be any positive real number to then motivate the distribution more generally. To explain its name, we recall the binomial series, i.e. \\[ (1+x)^s= 1 + s x + \\frac{s(s-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\ldots..., \\quad s\\in\\mathbb{R}; \\vert x \\vert&lt;1. \\] If we define \\(\\binom{s}{k}\\), the generalized binomial coefficient, by \\[ \\binom{s}{k}=\\frac{s(s-1)\\cdots(s-k+1)}{k!}, \\] then we have \\[ (1+x)^s= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{s}{k} x^k, \\quad s\\in\\mathbb{R}; \\vert x \\vert&lt;1. \\] If we let \\(s=-r\\), then we see that the above yields \\[ (1-x)^{-r}= 1 + r x + \\frac{(r+1)r}{2!}x^2 + \\ldots...= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r+k-1}{k} x^k, \\quad r\\in\\mathbb{R}; \\vert x \\vert&lt;1. \\] This implies that if we define \\(p_k\\) as \\[ p_k = \\binom{k+r-1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}\\right)^r \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}\\right)^k, \\quad k=0,1,\\ldots \\] for \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(\\beta\\geq0\\), then it defines a valid pmf. Such defined distribution is called the negative binomial distribution with parameters \\((r,\\beta)\\) with \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(\\beta\\geq 0\\). Moreover, the binomial series also implies that the pgf of this distribution is given by \\[ \\begin{aligned} P_N(z) &amp;= (1-\\beta(z-1))^{-r}, \\quad \\vert z \\vert &lt; 1+\\frac{1}{\\beta}, \\beta\\geq0. \\end{aligned} \\] The above implies that the mgf is given by \\[ \\begin{aligned} M_N(t) &amp;= (1-\\beta(e^t-1))^{-r}, \\quad t &lt; \\log\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right), \\beta\\geq0. \\end{aligned} \\] We derive its moments using Theorem 2.1 as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{E}[N]&amp;=&amp;M&#39;(0)= \\left. r\\beta e^t (1-\\beta(e^t-1))^{-r-1}\\right\\vert_{t=0}=r\\beta;\\\\ \\mathrm{E}[N^2]&amp;=&amp;M&#39;&#39;(0)= \\left.\\left[ r\\beta e^t (1-\\beta(e^t-1))^{-r-1} + r(r+1)\\beta^2 e^{2t} (1-\\beta(e^t-1))^{-r-2}\\right]\\right\\vert_{t=0}\\\\ &amp;=&amp;r\\beta(1+\\beta)+r^2\\beta^2;\\\\ \\hbox{and }\\mathrm{Var}[N]&amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{E}{[N^2]}-(\\mathrm{E}[{N}])^2=r\\beta(1+\\beta)+r^2\\beta^2-r^2\\beta^2=r\\beta(1+\\beta) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We note that when \\(\\beta&gt;0\\), we have \\(\\mathrm{Var}[N] &gt;\\mathrm{E}[N]\\). In other words, this distribution is overdispersedThe presence of greater variability (statistical dispersion) in a data set than would be expected based on a given statistical model (relative to the Poisson); similarly, when \\(q&gt;0\\) the binomial distribution is said to be underdispersedThere was less variation in the data than predicted (relative to the Poisson). Finally, we observe that the Poisson distribution also emerges as a limit of negative binomial distributions. Towards establishing this, let \\(\\beta_r\\) be such that as \\(r\\) approaches infinity \\(r\\beta_r\\) approaches \\(\\lambda&gt;0\\). Then we see that the mgfs of negative binomial distributions with parameters \\((r,\\beta_r)\\) satisfies \\[ \\lim_{r\\rightarrow 0} (1-\\beta_r(e^t-1))^{-r}=\\exp\\{\\lambda(e^t-1)\\}, \\] with the right hand side of the above equation being the mgf of the Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\).5 Show Quiz Solution 2.3 The (a, b, 0) Class In this section, you learn how to: Define the (a,b,0) class of frequency distributions Discuss the importance of the recursive relationship underpinning this class of distributions Identify conditions under which this general class reduces to each of the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions In the previous section we studied three distributions, namely the binomial, the Poisson and the negative binomial distributions. In the case of the Poisson, to derive its mean we used the the fact that \\[ kp_k=\\lambda p_{k-1}, \\quad k\\geq 1, \\] which can be expressed equivalently as \\[ \\frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}}=\\frac{\\lambda}{k}, \\quad k\\geq 1. \\] Interestingly, we can similarly show that for the binomial distribution \\[ \\frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}}=\\frac{-q}{1-q}+\\left(\\frac{(m+1)q}{1-q}\\right)\\frac{1}{k}, \\quad k=1,\\ldots,m, \\] and that for the negative binomial distribution \\[ \\frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}}=\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}+\\left(\\frac{(r-1)\\beta}{1+\\beta}\\right)\\frac{1}{k}, \\quad k\\geq 1. \\] The above relationships are all of the form \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}}=a+\\frac{b}{k}, \\quad k\\geq 1; \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] this raises the question if there are any other distributions which satisfy this seemingly general recurrence relation. Note that the ratio on the left, the ratio of two probabilities, is non-negative. To begin with, let \\(a&lt;0\\). In this case as \\(k\\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\((a+b/k)\\rightarrow a&lt;0\\). It follows that if \\(a&lt;0\\) then \\(b\\) should satisfy \\(b=-ka\\), for some \\(k\\geq 1\\). Any such pair \\((a,b)\\) can be written as \\[ \\left(\\frac{-q}{1-q},\\frac{(m+1)q}{1-q}\\right), \\quad q\\in(0,1), m\\geq 1; \\] note that the case \\(a&lt;0\\) with \\(a+b=0\\) yields the degenerate at \\(0\\) distribution which is the binomial distribution with \\(q=0\\) and arbitrary \\(m\\geq 1\\). In the case of \\(a=0\\), again by non-negativity of the ratio \\(p_k/p_{k-1}\\), we have \\(b\\geq 0\\). If \\(b=0\\) the distribution is degenerate at \\(0\\), which is a binomial with \\(q=0\\) or a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda=0\\) or a negative binomial distribution with \\(\\beta=0\\). If \\(b&gt;0\\), then clearly such a distribution is a Poisson distribution with mean (i.e. \\(\\lambda\\)) equal to \\(b\\), as presented at the beginning of this section. In the case of \\(a&gt;0\\), again by non-negativity of the ratio \\(p_k/p_{k-1}\\), we have \\(a+b/k\\geq 0\\) for all \\(k\\geq 1\\). The most stringent of these is the inequality \\(a+b\\geq 0\\). Note that \\(a+b=0\\) again results in degeneracy at \\(0\\); excluding this case we have \\(a+b&gt;0\\) or equivalently \\(b=(r-1)a\\) with \\(r&gt;0\\). Some algebra easily yields the following expression for \\(p_k\\): \\[ p_k = \\binom{k+r-1}{k} p_0 a^k, \\quad k=1,2,\\ldots. \\] The above series converges for \\(a&lt;1\\) when \\(r&gt;0\\), with the sum given by \\(p_0*((1-a)^{(-r)}-1)\\). Hence, equating the latter to \\(1-p_0\\) we get \\(p_0=(1-a)^{(r)}\\). So in this case the pair \\((a,b)\\) is of the form \\((a,(r-1)a)\\), for \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(0&lt;a&lt;1\\); since an equivalent parametrization is \\((\\beta/(1+\\beta),(r-1)\\beta/(1+\\beta))\\), for \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(\\beta&gt;0\\), we see from above that such distributions are negative binomial distributions. From the above development we see that not only does the recurrence (2.1) tie these three distributions together, but also it characterizes them. For this reason these three distributions are collectively referred to in the actuarial literature as (a,b,0) class of distributions, with \\(0\\) referring to the starting point of the recurrence. Note that the value of \\(p_0\\) is implied by \\((a,b)\\) since the probabilities have to sum to one. Of course, (2.1) as a recurrence relation for \\(p_k\\) makes the computation of the pmf efficient by removing redundancies. Later, we will see that it does so even in the case of compound distributions with the frequency distribution belonging to the \\((a,b,0)\\) class - this fact is the more important motivating reason to study these three distributions from this viewpoint. Example 2.3.1. A discrete probability distribution has the following properties \\[ \\begin{aligned} p_k&amp;=c\\left( 1+\\frac{2}{k}\\right) p_{k-1} \\:\\:\\: k=1,2,3,\\ldots\\\\ p_1&amp;= \\frac{9}{256} \\end{aligned} \\] Determine the expected value of this discrete random variable. Show Example Solution Solution: Since the pmf satisfies the \\((a,b,0)\\) recurrence relation we know that the underlying distribution is one among the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions. Since the ratio of the parameters (i.e. \\(b/a\\)) equals \\(2\\), we know that it is negative binomial and that \\(r=3\\). Moreover, since for a negative binomial \\(p_1=r(1+\\beta)^{-(r+1)}\\beta\\), we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp;\\frac{9}{256}=&amp;3\\frac{\\beta}{(1+\\beta)^4}\\\\ \\implies &amp;&amp;\\frac{3}{(1+3)^4}=&amp;\\frac{\\beta}{(1+\\beta)^4}\\\\ \\implies &amp;&amp;\\beta=&amp;3. \\end{aligned} \\] Finally, since the mean of a negative binomial is \\(r\\beta\\) we have the mean of the given distribution equals \\(9\\). Show Quiz Solution 2.4 Estimating Frequency Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Define a likelihood for a sample of observations from a discrete distribution Define the maximum likelihood estimator for a random sample of observations from a discrete distribution Calculate the maximum likelihood estimator for the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions 2.4.1 Parameter Estimation In Section 2.2 we introduced three distributions of importance in modeling various types of count data arising from insurance. Let us now suppose that we have a set of count data to which we wish to fit a distribution, and that we have determined that one of these \\((a,b,0)\\) distributions is more appropriate than the others. Since each one of these forms a class of distributions if we allow its parameter(s) to take any permissible value, there remains the task of determining the best value of the parameter(s) for the data at hand. This is a statistical point estimation problem, and in parametric inference problems the statistical inference paradigm of maximum likelihood usually yields efficient estimators. In this section we will describe this paradigm and derive the maximum likelihood estimators. Let us suppose that we observe the independent and identically distributed, iid, random variables \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n\\) from a distribution with pmf \\(p_\\theta\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a parameter and an unknown value in the parameter space \\(\\Theta\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d\\). For example, in the case of the Poisson distribution \\[ p_\\theta(x)=e^{-\\theta}\\frac{\\theta^x}{x!}, \\quad x=0,1,\\ldots, \\] with \\(\\theta=(0,\\infty)\\). In the case of the binomial distribution we have \\[ p_\\theta(x)=\\binom{m}{x} q^x(1-q)^{m-x}, \\quad x=0,1,\\ldots,m, \\] with \\(\\theta:=(m,q)\\in \\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}\\times[0,1]\\). Let us suppose that the observations are \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\), observed values of the random sample \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n\\) presented earlier. In this case, the probability of observing this sample from \\(p_\\theta\\) equals \\[ \\prod_{i=1}^n p_\\theta(x_i). \\] The above, denoted by \\(L(\\theta)\\), viewed as a function of \\(\\theta\\) is called the likelihood. Note that we suppressed its dependence on the data, to emphasize that we are viewing it as a function of the parameter. For example, in the case of the Poisson distribution we have \\[ L(\\lambda)=e^{-n\\lambda} \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i!\\right)^{-1}; \\] in the case of the binomial distribution we have \\[ L(m,q)=\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n \\binom{m}{x_i}\\right) q^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} (1-q)^{nm-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} . \\] The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)The possible value of the parameter for which the chance of observing the data largest for \\(\\theta\\) is any maximizer of the likelihood; in a sense the MLE chooses the set of parameter values that best explains the observed observations. Consider a sample of size \\(3\\) from a Bernoulli distribution (binomial with \\(m=1\\)) with values \\(0,1,0\\). The likelihood in this case is easily checked to equal \\[ L(q)=q(1-q)^2, \\] and the plot of the likelihood is given in Figure 2.1. As shown in the plot, the maximum value of the likelihood equals \\(4/27\\) and is attained at \\(q=1/3\\), and hence the maximum likelihood estimate for \\(q\\) is \\(1/3\\) for the given sample. In this case one can resort to algebra to show that \\[ q(1-q)^2=\\left(q-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\\left(q-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)+\\frac{4}{27}, \\] and conclude that the maximum equals \\(4/27\\), and is attained at \\(q=1/3\\) (using the fact that the first term is non-positive in the interval \\([0,1]\\)). But as is apparent, this way of deriving the mle using algebra does not generalize. In general, one resorts to calculus to derive the mle - note that for some likelihoods one may have to resort to other optimization methods, especially when the likelihood has many local extremaThe largest and smallest value of the function within a given range. It is customary to equivalently maximize the logarithm of the likelihood6 \\(L(\\cdot)\\), denoted by \\(l(\\cdot)\\), and look at the set of zeros of its first derivative7 \\(l&#39;(\\cdot)\\). In the case of the above likelihood, \\(l(q)=\\log(q)+2\\log(1-q)\\), and \\[ l&#39;(q):=\\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}q}l(q)=\\frac{1}{q}-\\frac{2}{1-q}. \\] The unique zero of \\(l&#39;(\\cdot)\\) equals \\(1/3\\), and since \\(l&#39;&#39;(\\cdot)\\) is negative, we have \\(1/3\\) is the unique maximizer of the likelihood and hence its maximum likelihood estimate. Figure 2.1: Likelihood of a \\((0,1,0)\\) \\(3\\)-sample from Bernoulli 2.4.2 Frequency Distributions MLE In the following, we derive the maximum likelihood estimator, MLE, for the three members of the \\((a,b,0)\\) class. We begin by summarizing the discussion above. In the setting of observing iid, independent and identically distributed, random variables \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n\\) from a distribution with pmf \\(p_\\theta\\), where \\(\\theta\\) takes an unknown value in \\(\\Theta\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d\\), the likelihood \\(L(\\cdot)\\), a function on \\(\\Theta\\) is defined as \\[ L(\\theta):=\\prod_{i=1}^n p_\\theta(x_i), \\] where \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) are the observed values. The MLE of \\(\\theta\\), denoted as \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\rm MLE}\\), is a function which maps the observations to an element of the set of maximizers of \\(L(\\cdot)\\), namely \\[ \\{\\theta \\vert L(\\theta)=\\max_{\\eta\\in\\Theta}L(\\eta)\\}. \\] Note the above set is a function of the observations, even though this dependence is not made explicit. In the case of the three distributions that we will study, and quite generally, the above set is a singleton with probability tending to one (with increasing sample size). In other words, for many commonly used distributions and when the sample size is large, the likelihood estimate is uniquely defined with high probability. In the following, we will assume that we have observed \\(n\\) iid random variables \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n\\) from the distribution under consideration, even though the parametric value is unknown. Also, \\(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\) will denote the observed values. We note that in the case of count data, and data from discrete distributions in general, the likelihood can alternately be represented as \\[ L(\\theta):=\\prod_{k\\geq 0} \\left(p_\\theta(k)\\right)^{m_k}, \\] where \\[ m_k:= \\left\\vert \\{i\\vert x_i=k, 1\\leq i \\leq n\\} \\right\\vert=\\sum_{i= 1}^n I(x_i=k), \\quad k\\geq 0. \\] Note that this transformation retains all of the data, compiling it in a streamlined manner. For large \\(n\\) it leads to compression of the data in the sense of sufficiency. Below, we present expressions for the MLE in terms of \\(\\{m_k\\}_{k\\geq 1}\\) as well. MLE - Poisson Distribution: In this case, as noted above, the likelihood is given by \\[ L(\\lambda)=\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i!\\right)^{-1}e^{-n\\lambda}\\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}, \\] which implies that \\[ l(\\lambda)= -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log(x_i!) -n\\lambda +\\log(\\lambda) \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i, \\] and \\[ l&#39;(\\lambda)= -n +\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i. \\] In evaluating \\(l&#39;&#39;(\\lambda)\\), when \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i&gt;0\\), \\(l&#39;&#39;&lt; 0\\). Consequently, the maximum is attained at the sample mean, \\(\\overline{x}\\), presented below. When \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i=0\\), the likelihood is a decreasing function and hence the maximum is attained at the least possible parameter value; this results in the maximum likelihood estimate being zero. Hence, we have \\[ \\overline{x} = \\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm MLE} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i. \\] Note that the sample mean can be computed also as \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k\\geq 1} km_k. \\] It is noteworthy that in the case of the Poisson, the exact distribution of \\(\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm MLE}\\) is available in closed form - it is a scaled Poisson - when the underlying distribution is a Poisson. This is so as the sum of independent Poisson random variables is a Poisson as well. Of course, for large sample size one can use the ordinary Central Limit Theorem (CLT)In some situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. to derive a normal approximation. Note that the latter approximation holds even if the underlying distribution is any distribution with a finite second moment. MLE - Binomial Distribution: Unlike the case of the Poisson distribution, the parameter space in the case of the binomial is \\(2\\)-dimensional. Hence the optimization problem is a bit more challenging. We begin by observing that the likelihood is given by \\[ L(m,q)= \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n \\binom{m}{x_i}\\right) q^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} (1-q)^{nm-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}, \\] and the log-likelihood by \\[ l(m,q)= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log\\left(\\binom{m}{x_i}\\right) + \\left({\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\\right)\\log(q)+ \\left({nm-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\\right)\\log(1-q). \\] Note that since \\(m\\) takes only non-negative integer values, we cannot use multivariate calculus to find the optimal values. Nevertheless, we can use single variable calculus to show that \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{q}_{\\rm MLE}\\times \\hat{m}_{\\rm MLE}= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i. \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] Towards this we note that for a fixed value of \\(m\\), \\[ \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta q} l(m,q) = \\left({\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\\right)\\frac{1}{q}- \\left({nm-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\\right)\\frac{1}{1-q}, \\] and that \\[ \\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta q^2} l(m,q) = -\\left[\\left({\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\\right)\\frac{1}{q^2} + \\left({nm-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\\right)\\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}\\right]\\leq 0. \\] The above implies that for any fixed value of \\(m\\), the maximizing value of \\(q\\) satisfies \\[ mq=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i, \\] and hence we establish equation (2.2). The above reduces the task to the search for \\(\\hat{m}_{\\rm MLE}\\), which is member of the set of the maximizers of \\[\\begin{equation} L\\left(m,\\frac{1}{nm}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\right). \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] Note the likelihood would be zero for values of \\(m\\) smaller than \\(\\max\\limits_{1\\leq i \\leq n}x_i\\), and hence \\[ \\hat{m}_{\\rm MLE}\\geq \\max_{1\\leq i \\leq n}x_i. \\] Towards specifying an algorithm to compute \\(\\hat{m}_{\\rm MLE}\\), we first point out that for some data sets \\(\\hat{m}_{\\rm MLE}\\) could equal \\(\\infty\\), indicating that a Poisson distribution would render a better fit than any binomial distribution. This is so as the binomial distribution with parameters \\((m,\\overline{x}/m)\\) approaches the Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\overline{x}\\) with \\(m\\) approaching infinity. The fact that some data sets will prefer a Poisson distribution should not be surprising since in the above sense the set of Poisson distribution is on the boundary of the set of binomial distributions. Interestingly, in (Olkin, Petkau, and Zidek 1981) they show that if the sample mean is less than or equal to the sample variance then \\(\\hat{m}_{\\rm MLE}=\\infty\\); otherwise, there exists a finite \\(m\\) that maximizes equation (2.3). In Figure 2.2 below we display the plot of \\(L\\left(m,\\frac{1}{nm}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\right)\\) for three different samples of size \\(5\\); they differ only in the value of the sample maximum. The first sample of \\((2,2,2,4,5)\\) has the ratio of sample mean to sample variance greater than \\(1\\) (\\(1.875\\)), the second sample of \\((2,2,2,4,6)\\) has the ratio equal to \\(1.25\\) which is closer to \\(1\\), and the third sample of \\((2,2,2,4,7)\\) has the ratio less than \\(1\\) (\\(0.885\\)). For these three samples, as shown in Figure 2.2, \\(\\hat{m}_{\\rm MLE}\\) equals \\(7\\), \\(18\\) and \\(\\infty\\), respectively. Note that the limiting value of \\(L\\left(m,\\frac{1}{nm}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\right)\\) as \\(m\\) approaches infinity equals \\[\\begin{equation} \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i! \\right)^{-1} \\exp\\left\\{-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\right\\} \\overline{x}^{n\\overline{x}}. \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] Also, note that Figure 2.2 shows that the MLE of \\(m\\) is non-robustResistant to errors in the results, produced by deviations from assumptions, i.e. changes in a small proportion of the data set can cause large changes in the estimator. The above discussion suggests the following simple algorithm: Step 1. If the sample mean is less than or equal to the sample variance, \\(\\hat{m}_{MLE}=\\infty\\). The MLE suggested distribution is a Poisson distribution with \\(\\hat{\\lambda}=\\overline{x}\\). Step 2. If the sample mean is greater than the sample variance, then compute \\(L(m,\\overline{x}/m)\\) for \\(m\\) values greater than or equal to the sample maximum until \\(L(m,\\overline{x}/m)\\) is close to the value of the Poisson likelihood given in (2.4). The value of \\(m\\) that corresponds to the maximum value of \\(L(m,\\overline{x}/m)\\) among those computed equals \\(\\hat{m}_{MLE}\\). We note that if the underlying distribution is the binomial distribution with parameters \\((m,q)\\) (with \\(q&gt;0\\)) then \\(\\hat{m}_{MLE}\\) will equal \\(m\\) for large sample sizes. Also, \\(\\hat{q}_{MLE}\\) will have an asymptotically normal distribution and converge with probability one to \\(q\\). Figure 2.2: Plot of \\(L(m,\\overline{x}/m)\\) for binomial distribution MLE - Negative Binomial Distribution: The case of the negative binomial distribution is similar to that of the binomial distribution in the sense that we have two parameters and the MLEs are not available in closed form. A difference between them is that unlike the binomial parameter \\(m\\) which takes positive integer values, the parameter \\(r\\) of the negative binomial can assume any positive real value. This makes the optimization problem a tad more complex. We begin by observing that the likelihood can be expressed in the following form: \\[ L(r,\\beta)=\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n \\binom{r+x_i-1}{x_i}\\right) (1+\\beta)^{-n(r+\\overline{x})} \\beta^{n\\overline{x}}. \\] The above implies that log-likelihood is given by \\[ l(r,\\beta)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log\\binom{r+x_i-1}{x_i} -n(r+\\overline{x}) \\log(1+\\beta) +n\\overline{x}\\log\\beta, \\] and hence \\[ \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\beta} l(r,\\beta) = -\\frac{n(r+\\overline{x})}{1+\\beta} + \\frac{n\\overline{x}}{\\beta}. \\] Equating the above to zero, we get \\[ \\hat{r}_{MLE}\\times \\hat{\\beta}_{MLE} = \\overline{x}. \\] The above reduces the two dimensional optimization problem to a one-dimensional problem - we need to maximize \\[ l(r,\\overline{x}/r)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log\\binom{r+x_i-1}{x_i} -n(r+\\overline{x}) \\log(1+\\overline{x}/r) +n\\overline{x}\\log(\\overline{x}/r), \\] with respect to \\(r\\), with the maximizing \\(r\\) being its MLE and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{MLE}=\\overline{x}/\\hat{r}_{MLE}\\). In (Levin, Reeds, and others 1977) it is shown that if the sample variance is greater than the sample mean then there exists a unique \\(r&gt;0\\) that maximizes \\(l(r,\\overline{x}/r)\\) and hence a unique MLE for \\(r\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Also, they show that if \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\leq \\overline{x}\\), then the negative binomial likelihood will be dominated by the Poisson likelihood with \\(\\hat{\\lambda}=\\overline{x}\\). In other words, a Poisson distribution offers a better fit to the data. The guarantee in the case of \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2&gt;\\hat{\\mu}\\) permits us to use some algorithm to maximize \\(l(r,\\overline{x}/r)\\). Towards an alternate method of computing the likelihood, we note that \\[ l(r,\\overline{x}/r)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{x_i}\\log(r-1+j) - \\sum_{i=1}^n\\log(x_i!) - n(r+\\overline{x}) \\log(r+\\overline{x}) + nr\\log(r) + n\\overline{x}\\log(\\overline{x}), \\] which yields \\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta r}l(r,\\overline{x}/r)=\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{x_i}\\frac{1}{r-1+j} - \\log(r+\\overline{x}) + \\log(r). \\] We note that, in the above expressions for the terms involving a double summation, the inner sum equals zero if \\(x_i=0\\). The maximum likelihood estimate for \\(r\\) is a root of the last expression and we can use a root finding algorithm to compute it. Also, we have \\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta r^2}l(r,\\overline{x}/r)=\\frac{\\overline{x}}{r(r+\\overline{x})}-\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{x_i}\\frac{1}{(r-1+j)^2}. \\] A simple but quickly converging iterative root finding algorithm is the Newton’s methodA root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function, which incidentally the Babylonians are believed to have used for computing square roots. Under this method, an initial approximation is selected for the root and new approximations for the root are successively generated until convergence. Applying the Newton’s method to our problem results in the following algorithm: Step i. Choose an approximate solution, say \\(r_0\\). Set \\(k\\) to \\(0\\). Step ii. Define \\(r_{k+1}\\) as \\[ r_{k+1}:= r_k - \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{x_i}\\frac{1}{r_k-1+j} - \\log(r_k+\\overline{x}) + \\log(r_k)}{\\frac{\\overline{x}}{r_k(r_k+\\overline{x})}-\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{x_i}\\frac{1}{(r_k-1+j)^2}} \\] Step iii. If \\(r_{k+1}\\sim r_k\\), then report \\(r_{k+1}\\) as maximum likelihood estimate; else increment \\(k\\) by \\(1\\) and repeat Step ii. For example, we simulated a \\(5\\) observation sample of \\(41, 49, 40, 27, 23\\) from the negative binomial with parameters \\(r=10\\) and \\(\\beta=5\\). Choosing the starting value of \\(r\\) such that \\[ r\\beta=\\hat{\\mu} \\quad \\hbox{and} \\quad r\\beta(1+\\beta)=\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\] where \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) represents the estimated mean and \\(hat{\\sigma}^2\\) is the estimated variance. This leads to the starting value for \\(r\\) of \\(23.14286\\). The iterates of \\(r\\) from the Newton’s method are \\[ 21.39627, 21.60287, 21.60647, 21.60647; \\] the rapid convergence seen above is typical of the Newton’s method. Hence in this example, \\(\\hat{r}_{MLE}\\sim21.60647\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{MLE}=8.3308\\).

The data was constructed to cover the three orderings of the sample mean and variance. As show in the Figure 2.3, and supported by theory, if \\(\\hat{\\mu}&lt;\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) then the negative binomial will result in a higher maximum likelihood value; if \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) the Poisson will have the highest likelihood value; and finally in the case that \\(\\hat{\\mu}&gt;\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) the binomial will give a better fit than the others. So before fitting a frequency data with an \\((a,b,0,)\\) distribution, it is best to start with examining the ordering of \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\). We again emphasize that the Poisson is on the boundary of the negative binomial and binomial distributions. So in the case that \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\geq\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) (\\(\\hat{\\mu}\\leq\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), resp.) the Poisson will yield a better fit than the negative binomial (binomial, resp.), which will also be indicated by \\(\\hat{r}=\\infty\\) (\\(\\hat{m}=\\infty\\), resp.). \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{c|c|c} \\hline \\text{Data} &amp; \\text{Mean }(\\hat{\\mu}) &amp; \\text{Variance }(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) \\\\ \\hline (2,3,6,8,9) &amp; 5.60 &amp; 7.44 \\\\ (2,5,6,8,9) &amp; 6 &amp; 6\\\\ (4,7,8,10,11) &amp; 8 &amp; 6\\\\\\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Table 2.1 : Three Samples of Size \\(5\\) Figure 2.3: Plot of \\((a,b,0)\\) Partially Maximized Likelihoods Show Quiz Solution 2.5 Other Frequency Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Define the (a,b,1) class of frequency distributions and discuss the importance of the recursive relationship underpinning this class of distributions Interpret zero truncated and modifed versions of the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions Compute probabilities using the recursive relationship In the previous sections, we discussed three distributions with supports contained in the set of non-negative integers, which well cater to many insurance applications. Moreover, typically by allowing the parameters to be a function of known (to the insurer) explanatory variablesIn regression, the explanatory variable is the one that is supposed to “explain” the other. such as age, sex, geographic location (territory), and so forth, these distributions allow us to explain claim probabilities in terms of these variables. The field of statistical study that studies such models is known as regression analysisA set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables - it is an important topic of actuarial interest that we will not pursue in this book; see (Edward W Frees 2009). There are clearly infinitely many other count distributions, and more importantly the above distributions by themselves do not cater to all practical needs. In particular, one feature of some insurance data is that the proportion of zero counts can be out of place with the proportion of other counts to be explainable by the above distributions. In the following we modify the above distributions to allow for arbitrary probability for zero count irrespective of the assignment of relative probabilities for the other counts. Another feature of a data set which is naturally comprised of homogeneousUnits of exposure that face approximately the same expected frequency and severity of loss. subsets is that while the above distributions may provide good fits to each subset, they may fail to do so to the whole data set. Later we naturally extend the \\((a,b,0)\\) distributions to be able to cater to, in particular, such data sets. 2.5.1 Zero Truncation or Modification Let us suppose that we are looking at auto insurance policies which appear in a database of auto claims made in a certain period. If one is to study the number of claims that these policies have made during this period, then clearly the distribution has to assign a probability of zero to the count variable assuming the value zero. In other words, by restricting attention to count data from policies in the database of claims, we have in a sense zero-truncated the count data of all policies. In personal lines (like auto), policyholders may not want to report that first claim because of fear that it may increase future insurance rates - this behavior will inflate the proportion of zero counts. Examples such as the latter modify the proportion of zero counts. Interestingly, natural modifications of the three distributions considered above are able to provide good fits to zero-modified/truncated data sets arising in insurance. As presented below, we modify the probability assigned to zero count by the \\((a,b,0)\\) class while maintaining the relative probabilities assigned to non-zero counts - zero modification. Note that since the \\((a,b,0)\\) class of distributions satisfies the recurrence (2.1), maintaining relative probabilities of non-zero counts implies that recurrence (2.1) is satisfied for \\(k\\geq 2\\). This leads to the definition of the following class of distributions. Definition. A count distribution is a member of the \\((a, b, 1)\\) class if for some constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) the probabilities \\(p_k\\) satisfy \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}}=a+\\frac{b}{k},\\quad k\\geq 2. \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] Note that since the recursion starts with \\(p_1\\), and not \\(p_0\\), we refer to this super-class of \\((a,b,0)\\) distributions by (a,b,1)A count distribution with probabilities satisfying p_k/p_{k-1}=a+b/k, for some some constants a and b and k&gt;=2. To understand this class, recall that each valid pair of values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) of the \\((a,b,0)\\) class corresponds to a unique vector of probabilities \\(\\{p_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\). If we now look at the probability vector \\(\\{\\tilde{p}_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\) given by \\[ \\tilde{p}_k= \\frac{1-\\tilde{p}_0}{1-p_0}\\cdot p_k, \\quad k\\geq 1, \\] where \\(\\tilde{p}_0\\in[0,1)\\) is arbitrarily chosen, then since the relative probabilities for positive values according to \\(\\{p_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\) and \\(\\{\\tilde{p}_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\) are the same, we have \\(\\{\\tilde{p}_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\) satisfies recurrence (2.5). This, in particular, shows that the class of \\((a,b,1)\\) distributions is strictly wider than that of \\((a,b,0)\\). In the above, we started with a pair of values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that led to a valid \\((a,b,0)\\) distribution, and then looked at the \\((a,b,1)\\) distributions that corresponded to this \\((a,b,0)\\) distribution. We will now argue that the \\((a,b,1)\\) class allows for a larger set of permissible distributions for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) than the \\((a,b,0)\\) class. Recall from Section 2.3 that in the case of \\(a&lt;0\\) we did not use the fact that the recurrence (2.1) started at \\(k=1\\), and hence the set of pairs \\((a,b)\\) with \\(a&lt;0\\) that are permissible for the \\((a,b,0)\\) class is identical to those that are permissible for the \\((a,b,1)\\) class. The same conclusion is easily drawn for pairs with \\(a=0\\). In the case that \\(a&gt;0\\), instead of the constraint \\(a+b&gt;0\\) for the \\((a,b,0)\\) class we now have the weaker constraint of \\(a+b/2&gt;0\\) for the \\((a,b,1)\\) class. With the parametrization \\(b=(r-1)a\\) as used in Section 2.3, instead of \\(r&gt;0\\) we now have the weaker constraint of \\(r&gt;-1\\). In particular, we see that while zero modifying a \\((a,b,0)\\) distribution leads to a distribution in the \\((a,b,1)\\) class, the conclusion does not hold in the other direction. Zero modification of a count distribution \\(F\\) such that it assigns zero probability to zero count is called a zero truncationZero modification of a count distribution such that it assigns zero probability to zero count of \\(F\\). Hence, the zero truncated version of probabilities \\(\\{p_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\) is given by \\[ \\tilde{p}_k=\\begin{cases} 0, &amp; k=0;\\\\ \\frac{p_k}{1-p_0}, &amp; k\\geq 1. \\end{cases} \\] In particular, we have that a zero modification of a count distribution \\(\\{p_k^T\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\), denoted by \\(\\{p^M_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\), can be written as a convex combinationA linear combination of points where all coefficients are non-negative and sum to 1 of the degenerate distributionA deterministic distribution and takes only a single value at \\(0\\) and the zero truncation of \\(\\{p_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\), denoted by \\(\\{p^T_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\). That is we have \\[ p^M_k= p^M_0 \\cdot \\delta_{0}(k) + (1-p^M_0) \\cdot p^T_k, \\quad k\\geq 0. \\] Example 2.5.1. Zero Truncated/Modified Poisson. Consider a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda=2\\). Calculate \\(p_k, k=0,1,2,3\\), for the usual (unmodified), truncated and a modified version with \\((p_0^M=0.6)\\). Show Example Solution Solution. For the Poisson distribution as a member of the (\\(a,b\\),0) class, we have \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=\\lambda=2\\). Thus, we may use the recursion \\(p_k = \\lambda p_{k-1}/k= 2 p_{k-1}/k\\) for each type, after determining starting probabilities. The calculation of probabilities for \\(k\\leq 3\\) is shown in Table 2.2. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\hline k &amp; p_k &amp; p_k^T &amp; p_k^M\\\\\\hline 0 &amp; p_0=e^{-\\lambda}=0.135335 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.6\\\\\\hline 1 &amp; p_1=p_0(0+\\frac{\\lambda}{1})=0.27067 &amp; \\frac{p_1}{1-p_0}=0.313035 &amp; \\frac{1-p_0^M}{1-p_0}~p_1=0.125214\\\\\\hline 2 &amp; p_2=p_1\\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right)=0.27067 &amp; p_2^T=p_1^T\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right)=0.313035 &amp; p_2^M=p_1^M\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right)=0.125214\\\\\\hline 3 &amp; p_3=p_2\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{3}\\right)=0.180447 &amp; p_3^T=p_2^T\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{3}\\right)=0.208690 &amp; p_3^M=p_2^M\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{3}\\right)=0.083476\\\\\\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Table 2.2 : Calculation of probabilities for \\(k\\leq 3\\) Show Quiz Solution 2.6 Mixture Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Define a mixture distribution when the mixing component is based on a finite number of sub-groups Compute mixture distribution probabilities from mixing proportions and knowledge of the distribution of each subgroup Define a mixture distribution when the mixing component is continuous In many applications, the underlying population consists of naturally defined sub-groups with some homogeneity within each sub-group. In such cases it is convenient to model the individual sub-groups, and in a ground-up manner model the whole population. As we shall see below, beyond the aesthetic appeal of the approach, it also extends the range of applications that can be catered to by standard parametric distributions. Let \\(k\\) denote the number of defined sub-groups in a population, and let \\(F_i\\) denote the distribution of an observation drawn from the \\(i\\)-th subgroup. If we let \\(\\alpha_i\\) denote the proportion of the population in the \\(i\\)-th subgroup, with \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha_i=1\\), then the distribution of a randomly chosen observation from the population, denoted by \\(F\\), is given by \\[\\begin{equation} F(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha_i \\cdot F_i(x). \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] The above expression can be seen as a direct application of the Law of Total Probability. As an example, consider a population of drivers split broadly into two sub-groups, those with at most \\(5\\)-years of driving experience and those with more than \\(5\\)-years experience. Let \\(\\alpha\\) denote the proportion of drivers with less than \\(5\\) years experience, and \\(F_{\\leq 5}\\) and \\(F_{&gt; 5}\\) denote the distribution of the count of claims in a year for a driver in each group, respectively. Then the distribution of claim count of a randomly selected driver is given by \\[ \\alpha\\cdot F_{\\leq 5}(x) + (1-\\alpha)F_{&gt; 5}(x). \\] An alternate definition of a mixture distributionThe probability distribution of a random variable that is derived from a collection of other random variables as follows: first, a random variable is selected by chance from the collection according to given probabilities of selection, and then the value of the selected random variable is realized is as follows. Let \\(N_i\\) be a random variable with distribution \\(F_i\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots, k\\). Let \\(I\\) be a random variable taking values \\(1,2,\\ldots,k\\) with probabilities \\(\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_k\\), respectively. Then the random variable \\(N_I\\) has a distribution given by equation (2.6)8. In (2.6) we see that the distribution function is a convex combination of the component distribution functions. This result easily extends to the density function, the survival function, the raw moments, and the expectation as these are all linear mappings of the distribution function. We note that this is not true for central moments like the variance, and conditional measures like the hazard rate function. In the case of variance it is easily seen as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var}{[N_I]}=\\mathrm{E}[{\\mathrm{Var}[{N_I\\vert I}]]} + \\mathrm{Var}[{\\mathrm{E}[{N_I|I}}]]=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha_i \\mathrm{Var}[{N_i}] + \\mathrm{Var}[{\\mathrm{E}[{N_I|I}}]] . \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] Appendix 16 provides additonal background about this important expression. Example 2.6.1. Actuarial Exam Question. In a certain town the number of common colds an individual will get in a year follows a Poisson distribution that depends on the individual’s age and smoking status. The distribution of the population and the mean number of colds are as follows: \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|c|c} \\hline &amp; \\text{Proportion of population} &amp; \\text{Mean number of colds}\\\\\\hline \\text{Children} &amp; 0.3 &amp; 3\\\\ \\text{Adult Non-Smokers} &amp; 0.6 &amp; 1\\\\ \\text{Adult Smokers} &amp; 0.1 &amp; 4\\\\\\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Table 2.3 : The distribution of the population and the mean number of colds Calculate the probability that a randomly drawn person has 3 common colds in a year. Calculate the conditional probability that a person with exactly 3 common colds in a year is an adult smoker. Show Example Solution Solution. Using Law of Total Probability, we can write the required probability as \\(\\Pr(N_I=3)\\), with \\(I\\) denoting the group of the randomly selected individual with \\(1,2\\) and \\(3\\) signifying the groups Children, Adult Non-Smoker, and Adult Smoker, respectively. Now by conditioning we get \\[ \\Pr(N_I=3)=0.3\\cdot\\Pr(N_1=3)+0.6\\cdot\\Pr(N_2=3)+0.1\\cdot\\Pr(N_3=3), \\] with \\(N_1,N_2\\) and \\(N_3\\) following Poisson distributions with means \\(3,1\\), and \\(4\\), respectively. Using the above, we get \\(\\Pr(N_I=3)\\sim0.1235\\) The conditional probability of event A given event B, \\(\\Pr(A\\vert B) = \\frac{\\Pr(A,B)}{\\Pr(B)}\\). The required conditional probability in this problem can then be written as \\(\\Pr(I=3\\vert N_I=3)\\), which equals \\[ \\Pr(I=3\\vert N_I=3)=\\frac{\\Pr(I=3,N_3=3)}{\\Pr(N_I=3)}\\sim\\frac{0.1 \\times 0.1954}{0.1235}\\sim 0.1581. \\] In the above example, the number of subgroups \\(k\\) was equal to three. In general, \\(k\\) can be any natural number, but when \\(k\\) is large it is parsimonious from a modeling point of view to take the following infinitely many subgroup approach. To motivate this approach, let the \\(i\\)-th subgroup be such that its component distribution \\(F_i\\) is given by \\(G_{\\tilde{\\theta_i}}\\), where \\(G_\\cdot\\) is a parametric family of distributions with parameter space \\(\\Theta\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d\\). With this assumption, the distribution function \\(F\\) of a randomly drawn observation from the population is given by \\[ F(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha_i G_{\\tilde{\\theta_i}}(x),\\quad \\forall x\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\] which can be alternately written as \\[ F(x)=\\mathrm{E}[{G_{\\tilde{\\vartheta}}(x)}],\\quad \\forall x\\in\\mathbb{R}, \\] where \\(\\tilde{\\vartheta}\\) takes values \\(\\tilde{\\theta_i}\\) with probability \\(\\alpha_i\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,k\\). The above makes it clear that when \\(k\\) is large, one could model the above by treating \\(\\tilde{\\vartheta}\\) as continuous random variable. To illustrate this approach, suppose we have a population of drivers with the distribution of claims for an individual driver being distributed as a Poisson. Each person has their own (personal) expected number of claims \\(\\lambda\\) - smaller values for good drivers, and larger values for others. There is a distribution of \\(\\lambda\\) in the population; a popular and convenient choice for modeling this distribution is a gamma distribution with parameters \\((\\alpha, \\theta)\\). With these specifications it turns out that the resulting distribution of \\(N\\), the claims of a randomly chosen driver, is a negative binomial with parameters \\((r=\\alpha,\\beta=\\theta)\\). This can be shown in many ways, but a straightforward argument is as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr(N=k)&amp;= \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!} \\frac{\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}e^{-\\lambda/\\theta}}{\\Gamma{(\\alpha)}\\theta^{\\alpha}} {\\rm d}\\lambda = \\frac{1}{k!\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\theta^\\alpha}\\int_0^\\infty \\lambda^{\\alpha+k-1}e^{-\\lambda(1+1/\\theta)}{\\rm d}\\lambda=\\frac{\\Gamma{(\\alpha+k)}}{k!\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\theta^\\alpha(1+1/\\theta)^{\\alpha+k}} \\\\ &amp;=\\binom{\\alpha+k-1}{k}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}\\right)^\\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^k, \\quad k=0,1,\\ldots \\end{align*}\\] Note that the above derivation implicitly uses the following: \\[ f_{N\\vert\\Lambda=\\lambda}(N=k)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!}, \\quad k\\geq 0; \\quad \\hbox{and} \\quad f_{\\Lambda}(\\lambda)= \\frac{\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}e^{-\\lambda/\\theta}}{\\Gamma{(\\alpha)}\\theta^{\\alpha}}, \\quad \\lambda&gt;0. \\] It is worth mentioning that by considering mixtures of a parametric class of distributions we increase the richness of the class. This expansion of distributions results in the mixture class being able to cater well to more applications that the parametric class we started with. Mixture modeling is a very important modeling technique in insurance applications, and later chapters will cover more aspects of this modeling technique. Example 2.6.2. Suppose that \\(N|\\Lambda \\sim\\) Poisson\\((\\Lambda)\\) and that \\(\\Lambda \\sim\\) gamma with mean of 1 and variance of 2. Determine the probability that \\(N=1\\). Show Example Solution Solution. For a gamma distribution with parameters \\((\\alpha, \\theta)\\), we have that the mean is \\(\\alpha \\theta\\) and the variance is \\(\\alpha \\theta^2\\). Using these expressions we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\alpha &amp;= \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ and } \\theta =2. \\end{aligned} \\] Now, one can directly use the above result to conclude that \\(N\\) is distributed as a negative binomial with \\(r = \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\beta= \\theta =2\\). Thus \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(N=1) &amp;= \\binom{1+r-1}{1}(\\frac{1}{(1+\\beta)^r})\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}\\right)^1 \\\\ &amp;= \\binom{1+\\frac{1}{2}-1}{1}{\\frac{1}{(1+2)^{1/2}}}\\left(\\frac{2}{1+2}\\right)^1\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{3^{3/2}} = 0.19245 . \\end{aligned} \\] Show Quiz Solution 2.7 Goodness of Fit In this section, you learn how to: Calculate a goodness of fit statistic to compare a hypothesized discrete distribution to a sample of discrete observations Compare the statistic to a reference distribution to assess the adequacy of the fit In the above we have discussed three basic frequency distributions, along with their extensions through zero modification/truncation and by looking at mixtures of these distributions. Nevertheless, these classes still remain parametric and hence by their very nature a small subset of the class of all possible frequency distributions (i.e. the set of distributions on non-negative integers.) Hence, even though we have talked about methods for estimating the unknown parameters, the fitted distribution will not be a good representation of the underlying distribution if the latter is far from the class of distribution used for modeling. In fact, it can be shown that the maximum likelihood estimator will converge to a value such that the corresponding distribution will be a Kullback-Leibler projection of the underlying distribution on the class of distributions used for modeling. Below we present one testing method - Pearson’s chi-square statistic - to check for the goodness of fitThe goodness of fit of a statistical model describes how well it fits a set of observations. of the fitted distribution. For more details on the Pearson’s chi-square testA statistical test applied to sets of categorical data to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance, at an introductory mathematical statistics level, we refer the reader to Section 9.1 of (Hogg, Tanis, and Zimmerman 2015). In \\(1993\\), a portfolio of \\(n=7,483\\) automobile insurance policies from a major Singaporean insurance company had the distribution of auto accidents per policyholder as given in Table 2.4. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \\hline \\text{Count }(k) &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; \\text{Total}\\\\ \\hline \\text{No. of Policies with }k\\text{ accidents }(m_k) &amp; 6,996 &amp; 455 &amp; 28 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 7483\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Table 2.4 : Singaporean Automobile Accident Data If we a fit a Poisson distribution, then the MLE for \\(\\lambda\\), the Poisson mean, is the sample mean which is given by \\[ \\overline{N} = \\frac{0\\cdot 6996 + 1 \\cdot 455 + 2 \\cdot 28 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 4 \\cdot 0}{7483} = 0.06989. \\] Now if we use Poisson (\\(\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}\\)) as the fitted distribution, then a tabular comparison of the fitted counts and observed counts is given by Table 2.5 below, where \\(\\hat{p}_k\\) represents the estimated probabilities under the fitted Poisson distribution. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{c|c|c} \\hline \\text{Count} &amp; \\text{Observed} &amp; \\text{Fitted Counts}\\\\ (k) &amp; (m_k) &amp; \\text{Using Poisson }(n\\hat{p}_k)\\\\ \\hline 0 &amp; 6,996 &amp; 6,977.86 \\\\ 1 &amp; 455 &amp; 487.70 \\\\ 2 &amp; 28 &amp; 17.04 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 0.40 \\\\ \\geq4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.01\\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; 7,483 &amp; 7,483.00\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Table 2.5 : Comparison of Observed to Fitted Counts: Singaporean Auto Data While the fit seems reasonable, a tabular comparison falls short of a statistical test of the hypothesis that the underlying distribution is indeed Poisson. The Pearson’s chi-square statistic is a goodness of fit statistical measure that can be used for this purpose. To explain this statistic let us suppose that a dataset of size \\(n\\) is grouped into \\(k\\) cells with \\(m_k/n\\) and \\(\\hat{p}_k\\), for \\(k=1\\ldots,K\\) being the observed and estimated probabilities of an observation belonging to the \\(k\\)-th cell, respectively. The Pearson’s chi-square test statistic is then given by \\[ \\sum_{k=1}^K\\frac{\\left( m_k-n\\widehat{p}_k \\right) ^{2}}{n\\widehat{p}_k}. \\] The motivation for the above statistic derives from the fact that \\[ \\sum_{k=1}^K\\frac{\\left( m_k-n{p}_k \\right) ^{2}}{n{p}_k} \\] has a limiting chi-square distributionThe chi-squared distribution with k degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables with \\(K-1\\) degrees of freedom if \\(p_k\\), \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\) are the true cell probabilities. Now suppose that only the summarized data represented by \\(m_k\\), \\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\) is available. Further, if \\(p_k\\)’s are functions of \\(s\\) parameters, replacing \\(p_k\\)’s by any efficiently estimated probabilities \\(\\widehat{p}_k\\)’s results in the statistic continuing to have a limiting chi-square distribution but with degrees of freedom given by \\(K-1-s\\). Such efficient estimates can be derived for example by using the MLE method (with a multinomial likelihoodThe multinomial distribution models the probability of counts for rolling a k-sided die n times) or by estimating the \\(s\\) parameters which minimizes the Pearson’s chi-square statistic above. For example, the R code below does calculate an estimate for \\(\\lambda\\) doing the latter and results in the estimate \\(0.06623153\\), close but different from the MLE of \\(\\lambda\\) using the full data: m&lt;-c(6996,455,28,4,0); op&lt;-m/sum(m); g&lt;-function(lam){sum((op-c(dpois(0:3,lam),1-ppois(3,lam)))^2)}; optim(sum(op*(0:4)),g,method=&quot;Brent&quot;,lower=0,upper=10)$par When one uses the full data to estimate the probabilities, the asymptotic distribution is in between chi-square distributions with parameters \\(K-1\\) and \\(K-1-s\\). In practice it is common to ignore this subtlety and assume the limiting chi-square has \\(K-1-s\\) degrees of freedom. Interestingly, this practical shortcut works quite well in the case of the Poisson distribution. For the Singaporean auto data the Pearson’s chi-square statistic equals \\(41.98\\) using the full data MLE for \\({\\lambda}\\). Using the limiting distribution of chi-square with \\(5-1-1=3\\) degrees of freedom, we see that the value of \\(41.98\\) is way out in the tail (\\(99\\)-th percentile is below \\(12\\)). Hence we can conclude that the Poisson distribution provides an inadequate fit for the data. In the above, we started with the cells as given in the above tabular summary. In practice, a relevant question is how to define the cells so that the chi-square distribution is a good approximation to the finite sample distribution of the statistic. A rule of thumb is to define the cells in such a way to have at least \\(80\\%\\), if not all, of the cells having expected counts greater than \\(5\\). Also, it is clear that a larger number of cells results in a higher power of the test, and hence a simple rule of thumb is to maximize the number of cells such that each cell has at least 5 observations.

In other words, if \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) are two random variables such that \\(N_1+c\\) has the same distribution as \\(N_2\\), for some constant \\(c\\), then the difference between the measures of the center of location of \\(N_2\\) and \\(N_1\\) must equal \\(c\\).

The traditional loss distribution approach to modeling aggregate lossesAggregate claims, or total claims observed in the time period starts by separately fitting a frequency distribution to the number of losses and a severity distribution to the size of losses. The estimated aggregate loss distribution combines the loss frequency distribution and the loss severity distribution by convolution. Discrete distributions often referred to as counting or frequency distributions were used in Chapter 2 to describe the number of events such as number of accidents to the driver or number of claims to the insurer. Lifetimes, asset values, losses and claim sizes are usually modeled as continuous random variables and as such are modeled using continuous distributions, often referred to as loss or severity distributions. A mixture distributionA weighted average of other distributions, which may be continuous or discrete is a weighted combination of simpler distributions that is used to model phenomenon investigated in a heterogeneous population, such as modelling more than one type of claims in liability insuranceInsurance that compensates an insured for loss due to legal liability towards others (small frequent claims and large relatively rare claims). In this chapter we explore the use of continuous as well as mixture distributions to model the random size of loss. We present key attributes that characterize continuous models and means of creating new distributions from existing ones. We also explore the effect of coverage modifications, which change the conditions that trigger a payment, such as applying deductibles, limits, or adjusting for inflation, on the distribution of individual loss amounts. The frequency distributions from Chapter 2 will be combined with the ideas from this chapter to describe the aggregate losses over the whole portfolio in Chapter 5. 3.1 Basic Distributional Quantities In this section, you learn how to define some basic distributional quantities: moments, percentiles, and generating functions. 3.1.1 Moments Let \\(X\\) be a continuous random variableRandom variable which can take infinitely many values in its specified domain with probability density function \\(f_{X}\\left( x \\right)\\). The k-th raw momentThe kth moment of a random variable x is the average (expected) value of x^k of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(\\mu_{k}^{\\prime}\\), is the expected valueAverage of the k-th power of \\(X\\), provided it exists. The first raw moment \\(\\mu_{1}^{\\prime}\\) is the mean of \\(X\\) usually denoted by \\(\\mu\\). The formula for \\(\\mu_{k}^{\\prime}\\) is given as \\[ \\mu_{k}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{x^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right)dx } . \\] The support of the random variable \\(X\\) is assumed to be nonnegative since actuarial phenomena are rarely negative. An easy integration by parts shows that the raw moments for nonnegative variables can also be computed using \\[ \\mu_{k}^{\\prime} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{k~x^{k-1}\\left[1- F_{X}(x) \\right]dx }, \\] that is based on the survival function, denoted as \\(S_X(x) = 1-F_{X}(x)\\). This formula is particularly useful when \\(k=1\\). The k-th central momentThe kth central moment of a random variable x is the expected value of (x-its mean)^k of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(\\mu_{k}\\), is the expected value of the k-th power of the deviation of \\(X\\) from its mean \\(\\mu\\). The formula for \\(\\mu_{k}\\) is given as \\[ \\mu_{k} = \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack {(X - \\mu)}^{k} \\right\\rbrack = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{\\left( x - \\mu \\right)^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right) dx }. \\] The second central moment \\(\\mu_{2}\\) defines the varianceSecond central moment of a random variable x, measuring the expected squared deviation of between the variable and its mean of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(\\sigma^{2}\\). The square root of the variance is the standard deviationThe square-root of variance \\(\\sigma\\). From a classical perspective, further characterization of the shape of the distribution includes its degree of symmetry as well as its flatness compared to the normal distribution. The ratio of the third central moment to the cube of the standard deviation \\(\\left( \\mu_{3} / \\sigma^{3} \\right)\\) defines the coefficient of skewnessMeasure of the symmetry of a distribution, 3rd central moment/standard deviation^3 which is a measure of symmetry. A positive coefficient of skewness indicates that the distribution is skewed to the right (positively skewed). The ratio of the fourth central moment to the fourth power of the standard deviation \\(\\left(\\mu_{4} / \\sigma^{4} \\right)\\) defines the coefficient of kurtosisMeasure of the peaked-ness of a distribution, 4th central moment/standard deviation^4. The normal distribution has a coefficient of kurtosis of 3. Distributions with a coefficient of kurtosis greater than 3 have heavier tails and higher peak than the normal, whereas distributions with a coefficient of kurtosis less than 3 have lighter tails and are flatter. Section 10.2 describes the tails of distributions from an insurance and actuarial perspective. Example 3.1.1. Actuarial Exam Question. Assume that the rvRandom variable \\(X\\) has a gamma distribution with mean 8 and skewness 1. Find the variance of \\(X\\). (Hint: The gamma distribution is reviewed in Section 3.2.1.) Show Example Solution Solution. The probability density function of \\(X\\) is given by \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\left( x / \\theta \\right)^{\\alpha}}{x ~\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha \\right)} e^{- x / \\theta} \\] for \\(x &gt; 0\\). For \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\), the k-th raw moment is \\[ \\mu_{k}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{\\frac{1}{\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha \\right)\\theta^{\\alpha}}x^{k + \\alpha - 1}e^{- x / \\theta} dx} = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left( k + \\alpha \\right)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha \\right)}\\theta^{k} \\] Given \\(\\Gamma\\left( r + 1 \\right) = r\\Gamma\\left( r \\right)\\) and \\(\\Gamma\\left( 1 \\right) = 1\\), then \\(\\mu_{1}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\alpha\\theta\\), \\(\\mu_{2}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{2} \\right) = \\left( \\alpha + 1 \\right)\\alpha\\theta^{2}\\), \\(\\mu_{3}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{3} \\right) = \\left( \\alpha + 2 \\right)\\left( \\alpha + 1 \\right)\\alpha\\theta^{3}\\), and \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right) = (\\alpha + 1)\\alpha\\theta^2 - (\\alpha\\theta)^2 = \\alpha\\theta^{2}\\). \\[ \\text{Skewness} = \\frac{\\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack {(X - \\mu_{1}^{\\prime})}^{3} \\right\\rbrack}{{\\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right)}^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\mu_{3}^{\\prime} - 3\\mu_{2}^{\\prime}\\mu_{1}^{\\prime} + 2{\\mu_{1}^{\\prime}}^{3}}{{\\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right)}^{3/2}} \\\\ = \\frac{\\left( \\alpha + 2 \\right)\\left( \\alpha + 1 \\right)\\alpha\\theta^{3} - 3\\left( \\alpha + 1 \\right)\\alpha^{2}\\theta^{3} + 2\\alpha^{3}\\theta^{3}}{\\left( \\alpha\\theta^{2} \\right)^{3/2}} = \\frac{2}{\\alpha^{1/2}} = 1. \\] Hence, \\(\\alpha = 4\\). Since, \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\alpha\\theta = 8\\), then \\(\\theta = 2\\) and finally, \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right) = \\alpha\\theta^{2} = 16\\). 3.1.2 Quantiles Quantiles can also be used to describe the characteristics of the distribution of \\(X\\). When the distribution of \\(X\\) is continuous, for a given fraction \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\) the corresponding quantile is the solution of the equation \\[ F_{X}\\left( \\pi_{p} \\right) = p . \\] For example, the middle point of the distribution, \\(\\pi_{0.5}\\), is the median50th percentile of a definition, or middle value where half of the distribution lies below. A percentileThe pth percentile of a random variable x is the smallest value x_p such that the probability of not exceeding it is p% is a type of quantile; a \\(100p\\) percentile is the number such that \\(100 \\times p\\) percent of the data is below it. Example 3.1.1. Actuarial Exam Question. Let \\(X\\) be a continuous random variable with density function \\(f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\theta e^{- \\theta x}\\), for \\(x &gt; 0\\) and 0 elsewhere. If the median of this distribution is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), find \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The distribution function is \\(F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = 1 - e^{- \\theta x}\\). So, \\(F_{X}\\left( \\pi_{0.5} \\right) = 1 - e^{- \\theta\\pi_{0.5}} = 0.5\\). As, \\(\\pi_{0.5} = \\frac{1}{3}\\), we have \\(F_X\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1 - e^{-\\theta / 3} = 0.5\\) and \\(\\theta = 3 \\ln 2\\). Section 4.1.1.3 will extend the definition of quantiles to include distributions that are discrete, continuous, or a hybrid combination. 3.1.3 Moment Generating Function The moment generating function, denoted by \\(M_{X}(t)\\) uniquely characterizes the distribution of \\(X\\). While it is possible for two different distributions to have the same moments and yet still differ, this is not the case with the moment generating function. That is, if two random variables have the same moment generating function, then they have the same distribution. The moment generating function is given by \\[ M_{X}(t) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( e^{tX} \\right) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{e^{\\text{tx}}f_{X}\\left( x \\right) dx } \\] for all \\(t\\) for which the expected value exists. The moment generating is a real function whose k-th derivative at zero is equal to the k-th raw moment of \\(X\\). In symbols, this is \\[ \\left.\\frac{d^k}{dt^k} M_{X}(t)\\right|_{t=0} = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) . \\] Example 3.1.3. Actuarial Exam Question. The random variable \\(X\\) has an exponential distribution with mean \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\). It is found that \\(M_{X}\\left( - b^{2} \\right) = 0.2\\). Find \\(b\\). (Hint: The exponential is a special case of the gamma distribution which is reviewed in Section 3.2.1.) Show Example Solution Solution. With \\(X\\) having an exponential distribution with mean \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\), we have that \\[ M_{X}(t) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( e^{tX} \\right) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{e^{\\text{tx}}be^{- bx} dx} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{be^{- x\\left( b - t \\right)} dx} = \\frac{b}{\\left( b - t \\right)}. \\] Then, \\[ M_{X}\\left( - b^{2} \\right) = \\frac{b}{\\left( b + b^{2} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\left( 1 + b \\right)} = 0.2. \\] Thus, \\(b = 4\\). Example 3.1.4. Actuarial Exam Question. Let \\(X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\) be independentTwo variables are independent if conditional information given about one variable provides no information regarding the other variable random variables, where \\(X_i\\) has a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) and \\(\\theta\\). Find the distribution of \\(S = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}X_{i}\\), the mean \\(\\mathrm{E}(S)\\), and the variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}(S)\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The moment generating function of \\(S\\) is \\[ M_{S}(t) = \\text{E}\\left( e^{\\text{tS}} \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( e^{t\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}X_{i}} \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}e^{tX_{i}} \\right) . \\] Using independence, we get \\[ M_{S}(t) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}{\\mathrm{E}\\left( e^{tX_{i}} \\right) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}{M_{X_{i}}(t)}} . \\] The moment generating function of the gamma distribution \\(X_i\\) is \\(M_{X_i}(t) = (1-\\theta)^{\\alpha_i}\\). . Then, \\[ M_{S}(t) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}\\left( 1 - \\theta t \\right)^{- \\alpha_{i}} = \\left( 1 - \\theta t \\right)^{- \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\alpha_{i}} . \\] This indicates that the distribution of \\(S\\) is gamma with parameters \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\alpha_{i}\\) and \\(\\theta\\). This is a demonstration of how we can use the uniqueness property of the moment generating function to determine the probability distribution of a random variable. We can find the mean and variance from the properties of the gamma distribution. Alternatively, by finding the first and second derivatives of \\(M_{S}(t)\\) at zero, we can show that \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( S \\right) = \\left. \\ \\frac{\\partial M_{S}(t)}{\\partial t} \\right|_{t = 0} = \\alpha\\theta\\) where \\(\\alpha = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\alpha_{i}\\), and \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( S^{2} \\right) = \\left. \\ \\frac{\\partial^{2}M_{S}(t)}{\\partial t^{2}} \\right|_{t = 0} = \\left( \\alpha + 1 \\right)\\alpha\\theta^{2}. \\] Hence, \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left( S \\right) = \\alpha\\theta^{2}\\). One can also use the moment generating function to compute the probability generating function \\[ P_{X}(z) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( z^{X} \\right) = M_{X}\\left( \\ln z \\right) . \\] As introduced in Section 2.2.2, the probability generating function is more useful for discrete rvs. Show Quiz Solution 3.2 Continuous Distributions for Modeling Loss Severity In this section, you learn how to define and apply four fundamental severity distributions: gamma, Pareto, Weibull, and generalized beta distribution of the second kind. 3.2.1 Gamma Distribution Recall that the traditional approach in modelling losses is to fit separate models for claim frequency and claim severity. When frequency and severity are modeled separately it is common for actuaries to use the Poisson distribution (introduced in Section 2.2.3.2) for claim count and the gamma distribution to model severity. An alternative approach for modelling losses that has recently gained popularity is to create a single model for pure premium (average claim cost) that will be described in Chapter 4. The continuous variable \\(X\\) is said to have the gamma distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameter \\(\\theta\\) if its probability density function is given by \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\left( x/ \\theta \\right)^{\\alpha}}{x~ \\Gamma\\left( \\alpha \\right)}\\exp \\left( -x/ \\theta \\right) \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } x &gt; 0 . \\] Note that \\(\\alpha &gt; 0,\\ \\theta &gt; 0\\). The two panels in Figure 3.1 demonstrate the effect of the scale and shape parameters on the gamma density function. Figure 3.1: Gamma Densities. The left-hand panel is with shape=2 and Varying Scale. The right-hand panel is with scale=100 and Varying Shape.

As we will see in Section 15.4, the chi-square distribution is used extensively in statistical hypothesis testing. The distribution function of the gamma model is the incomplete gamma function, denoted by \\(\\Gamma\\left(\\alpha; \\frac{x}{\\theta} \\right)\\), and defined as \\[ F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\Gamma\\left( \\alpha; \\frac{x}{\\theta} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha \\right)}\\int_{0}^{x /\\theta}t^{\\alpha - 1}e^{- t}~dt \\] \\(\\alpha &gt; 0,\\ \\theta &gt; 0\\). For an integer \\(\\alpha\\), it can be written as \\(\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha; \\frac{x}{\\theta} \\right) = 1 - e^{-x/\\theta}\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\alpha-1}\\frac{(x/\\theta)^k}{k!}\\). The \\(k\\)-th moment of the gamma distributed random variable for any positive \\(k\\) is given by \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\theta^{k} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha + k \\right)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha \\right)} . \\] The mean and variance are given by \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\alpha\\theta\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right) = \\alpha\\theta^{2}\\), respectively. Since all moments exist for any positive \\(k\\), the gamma distribution is considered a light tailed distributionA distribution with thinner tails than the benchmark exponential distribution, which may not be suitable for modeling risky assets as it will not provide a realistic assessment of the likelihood of severe losses. 3.2.2 Pareto Distribution The Pareto distributionA heavy-tailed and positively skewed distribution with 2 parameters, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1843-1923), has many economic and financial applications. It is a positively skewed and heavy-tailed distribution which makes it suitable for modeling income, high-risk insurance claims and severity of large casualty losses. The survival function of the Pareto distribution which decays slowly to zero was first used to describe the distribution of income where a small percentage of the population holds a large proportion of the total wealth. For extreme insurance claims, the tail of the severity distribution (losses in excess of a threshold) can be modeled using a Generalized Pareto distribution. The continuous variable \\(X\\) is said to have the Pareto distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameter \\(\\theta\\) if its pdfProbability density function is given by \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha\\theta^{\\alpha}}{\\left( x + \\theta \\right)^{\\alpha + 1}} \\ \\ \\ x &gt; 0,\\ \\alpha &gt; 0,\\ \\theta &gt; 0. \\] The two panels in Figure 3.2 demonstrate the effect of the scale and shape parameters on the Pareto density function.

The right-hand panel is with shape=3 and ,Varying Scale R Code for Pareto Density Plots library(VGAM) par(mfrow=c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # Varying Shape Pareto Densities x &lt;- seq(1, 3000, by = 1) scaleparam &lt;- seq(2000, 3500, 500) shapeparam &lt;- 1:4 # varying the shape parameter plot(x, dparetoII(x, loc=0, shape = shapeparam[1], scale = 2000), ylim=c(0,0.002),type = &quot;l&quot;, ylab = &quot;Pareto density&quot;) for(k in 2:length(shapeparam)){ lines(x, dparetoII(x, loc=0, shape = shapeparam[k], scale = 2000), col = k) } legend(&quot;topright&quot;, c(expression(alpha~&#39;=1&#39;), expression(alpha~&#39;=2&#39;), expression(alpha~&#39;=3&#39;), expression(alpha~&#39;=4&#39;)), lty=1, col = 1:4) # Varying Scale Pareto Densities plot(x, dparetoII(x, loc=0, shape = 3, scale = scaleparam[1]), type = &quot;l&quot;, ylab = &quot;Pareto density&quot;) for(k in 2:length(scaleparam)){ lines(x, dparetoII(x, loc=0, shape = 3, scale = scaleparam[k]), col = k) } legend(&quot;topright&quot;, c(expression(theta~&#39;=2000&#39;), expression(theta~&#39;=2500&#39;), expression(theta~&#39;=3000&#39;), expression(theta~&#39;=3500&#39;)), lty=1, col = 1:4) The distribution function of the Pareto distribution is given by \\[ F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{x + \\theta} \\right)^{\\alpha} \\ \\ \\ x &gt; 0,\\ \\alpha &gt; 0,\\ \\theta &gt; 0. \\] It can be easily seen that the hazard functionRatio of the probability density function and the survival function: f(x)/s(x), and represents an instantaneous probability within a small time frame of the Pareto distribution is a decreasing function in \\(x\\), another indication that the distribution is heavy tailed. When the hazard function decreases over time the population dies off at a decreasing rate resulting in a heavier tail for the distribution. The hazard function reveals information about the tail distribution and is often used to model data distributions in survival analysis. The hazard function is defined as the instantaneous potential that the event of interest occurs within a very narrow time frame. The \\(k\\)-th moment of the Pareto distributed random variable exists, if and only if, \\(\\alpha &gt; k\\). If \\(k\\) is a positive integer then \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\frac{\\theta^{k}~ k!}{\\left( \\alpha - 1 \\right)\\cdots\\left( \\alpha - k \\right)} \\ \\ \\ \\alpha &gt; k. \\] The mean and variance are given by \\[\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha - 1} \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } \\alpha &gt; 1\\] and \\[\\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha\\theta^{2}}{\\left( \\alpha - 1 \\right)^{2}\\left( \\alpha - 2 \\right)} \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } \\alpha &gt; 2,\\]respectively. Example 3.2.1. The claim size of an insurance portfolio follows the Pareto distribution with mean and variance of 40 and 1800 respectively. Find The shape and scale parameters. The 95-th percentile of this distribution. Show Example Solution Solution. a. As, \\(X\\sim Pa(\\alpha,\\theta)\\), we have \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha - 1} = 40\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha\\theta^{2}}{\\left( \\alpha - 1 \\right)^{2}\\left( \\alpha - 2 \\right)} = 1800\\). By dividing the square of the first equation by the second we get \\(\\frac{\\alpha - 2}{\\alpha} = \\frac{40^{2}}{1800}\\). Thus, \\(\\alpha = 18.02\\) and \\(\\theta = 680.72\\). b. The 95-th percentile, \\(\\pi_{0.95}\\), satisfies the equation \\[ F_{X}\\left( \\pi_{0.95} \\right) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{680.72}{\\pi_{0.95} + 680.72} \\right)^{18.02} = 0.95. \\] Thus, \\(\\pi_{0.95} = 122.96\\). 3.2.3 Weibull Distribution The Weibull distributionA positively skewed continuous distribution with 2 parameters that can have an increasing or decreasing hazard function depending on the shape parameter, named after the Swedish physicist Waloddi Weibull (1887-1979) is widely used in reliability, life data analysis, weather forecasts and general insurance claims. Truncated data arise frequently in insurance studies. The Weibull distribution has been used to model excess of loss treaty over automobile insurance as well as earthquake inter-arrival times. The continuous variable \\(X\\) is said to have the Weibull distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameter \\(\\theta\\) if its probability density function is given by \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\theta}\\left( \\frac{x}{\\theta} \\right)^{\\alpha - 1} \\exp \\left(- \\left( \\frac{x}{\\theta} \\right)^{\\alpha}\\right) \\ \\ \\ x &gt; 0,\\ \\alpha &gt; 0,\\ \\theta &gt; 0. \\] The two panels Figure 3.3 demonstrate the effects of the scale and shape parameters on the Weibull density function. Figure 3.3: Weibull Densities. The left-hand panel is with shape=3 and Varying Scale. The right-hand panel is with scale=100 and Varying Shape. R Code for Weibull Density Plots par(mfrow=c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # Varying Scale Weibull Densities z&lt;- seq(0,400,by=1) scaleparam &lt;- seq(50,200,50) shapeparam &lt;- seq(1.5,3,0.5) plot(z, dweibull(z, shape = 3, scale = scaleparam[1]), type = &quot;l&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weibull density&quot;) for(k in 2:length(scaleparam)){ lines(z,dweibull(z,shape = 3, scale = scaleparam[k]), col = k)} legend(&quot;topright&quot;, c(&quot;scale=50&quot;, &quot;scale=100&quot;, &quot;scale=150&quot;, &quot;scale=200&quot;), lty=1, col = 1:4) # Varying Shape Weibull Densities plot(z, dweibull(z, shape = shapeparam[1], scale = 100), ylim=c(0,0.012), type = &quot;l&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weibull density&quot;) for(k in 2:length(shapeparam)){ lines(z,dweibull(z,shape = shapeparam[k], scale = 100), col = k)} legend(&quot;topright&quot;, c(&quot;shape=1.5&quot;, &quot;shape=2&quot;, &quot;shape=2.5&quot;, &quot;shape=3&quot;), lty=1, col = 1:4) The distribution function of the Weibull distribution is given by \\[ F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = 1 - e^{- \\left( x / \\theta \\right)^{\\alpha}} \\ \\ \\ x &gt; 0,\\ \\alpha &gt; 0,\\ \\theta &gt; 0. \\] It can be easily seen that the shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) describes the shape of the hazard function of the Weibull distribution. The hazard function is a decreasing function when \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\) (heavy tailed distribution), constant when \\(\\alpha = 1\\) and increasing when \\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\) (light tailed distribution). This behavior of the hazard function makes the Weibull distribution a suitable model for a wide variety of phenomena such as weather forecasting, electrical and industrial engineering, insurance modeling, and financial risk analysis. The \\(k\\)-th moment of the Weibull distributed random variable is given by \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\theta^{k}~\\Gamma\\left( 1 + \\frac{k}{\\alpha} \\right) . \\] The mean and variance are given by \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\theta~\\Gamma\\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\right) \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var}(X)= \\theta^{2}\\left( \\Gamma\\left( 1 + \\frac{2}{\\alpha} \\right) - \\left\\lbrack \\Gamma\\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\right) \\right\\rbrack ^{2}\\right), \\] respectively. Example 3.2.2. Suppose that the probability distribution of the lifetime of AIDS patients (in months) from the time of diagnosis is described by the Weibull distribution with shape parameter 1.2 and scale parameter 33.33. Find the probability that a randomly selected person from this population survives at least 12 months, A random sample of 10 patients will be selected from this population. What is the probability that at most two will die within one year of diagnosis. Find the 99-th percentile of the distribution of lifetimes. Show Example Solution Solution. a. Let \\(X\\) be the lifetime of AIDS patients (in months) having a Weibull distribution with parameters \\(\\left( 1.2,33.33 \\right)\\). We have, \\[ \\Pr \\left( X \\geq 12 \\right) = S_{X} \\left( 12 \\right) = e^{- \\left( \\frac{12}{33.33} \\right)^{1.2}} = 0.746. \\] b. Let \\(Y\\) be the number of patients who die within one year of diagnosis. Then, \\(Y\\sim Bin\\left( 10,\\ 0.254 \\right)\\) and \\(\\Pr\\left( Y \\leq 2 \\right) = 0.514.\\) c. Let \\(\\pi_{0.99}\\) denote the 99-th percentile of this distribution. Then, \\[ S_{X}\\left( \\pi_{0.99} \\right) = \\exp\\left\\{- \\left( \\frac{\\pi_{0.99}}{33.33} \\right)^{1.2}\\right\\} = 0.01. \\] Solving for \\(\\pi_{0.99}\\), we get \\(\\pi_{0.99} = 118.99\\). 3.2.4 The Generalized Beta Distribution of the Second Kind The Generalized Beta Distribution of the Second KindA 4-parameter flexible distribution that encompasses many common distributions (GB2) was introduced by Venter (1983) in the context of insurance loss modeling and by McDonald (1984) as an income and wealth distribution. It is a four-parameter very flexible distribution that can model positively as well as negatively skewed distributions. The continuous variable \\(X\\) is said to have the GB2 distribution with parameters \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\alpha_1\\) and \\(\\alpha_2\\) if its probability density function is given by \\[\\begin{equation} f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{(x/\\theta)^{\\alpha_2/\\sigma}}{x \\sigma~\\mathrm{B}\\left( \\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\right)\\left\\lbrack 1 + \\left( x/\\theta \\right)^{1/\\sigma} \\right\\rbrack^{\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2}} \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } x &gt; 0, \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\sigma,\\theta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2 &gt; 0\\), and where the beta function \\(\\mathrm{B}\\left( \\alpha_1,\\alpha_2 \\right)\\) is defined as \\[ \\mathrm{B}\\left( \\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\right) = \\int_{0}^{1}{t^{\\alpha_1 - 1}\\left( 1 - t \\right)^{\\alpha_2 - 1}}~ dt. \\] The GB2 provides a model for heavy as well as light tailed data. It includes the exponential, gamma, Weibull, Burr, Lomax, F, chi-square, Rayleigh, lognormal and log-logistic as special or limiting cases. For example, by setting the parameters \\(\\sigma = \\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = 1\\), then the GB2 reduces to the log-logistic distribution. When \\(\\sigma = 1\\) and \\(\\alpha_2 \\rightarrow \\infty\\), it reduces to the gamma distribution and when \\(\\alpha = 1\\) and \\(\\alpha_2 \\rightarrow \\infty\\), it reduces to the Weibull distribution. A GB2 random variable can be defined as follows. Suppose that \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) are independent random variables where \\(G_i\\) has a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_i\\) and scale parameter 1. Then, one can show that the random variable \\(X = \\theta \\left(\\frac{G_1}{G_2}\\right)^{\\sigma}\\) has a GB2 distribution with pdf summarized in equation (3.1). This theoretical result has several implications. For example, when the moments exist, one can show that the \\(k\\)-th moment of the GB2 distributed random variable is given by \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\frac{\\theta^{k}~\\mathrm{B}\\left( \\alpha_1 +k \\sigma,\\alpha_2 - k \\sigma \\right)}{\\mathrm{B}\\left( \\alpha_1,\\alpha_2 \\right)}, \\ \\ \\ k &gt; 0. \\] Earlier applications of the GB2 were on income data and more recently have been used to model long-tailed claims data (Section 10.2 describes different interpretations of the descriptor “long-tail”). GB2 was used to model different types of automobile insurance claims, severity of fire losses as well as medical insurance claim data. Show Quiz Solution 3.3 Methods of Creating New Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Understand connections among the distributions Give insights into when a distribution is preferred when compared to alternatives Provide foundations for creating new distributions 3.3.1 Functions of Random Variables and their Distributions In Section 3.2 we discussed some elementary known distributions. In this section we discuss means of creating new parametric probability distributions from existing ones. Specifically, let \\(X\\) be a continuous random variable with a known probability density function \\(f_{X}(x)\\) and distribution function \\(F_{X}(x)\\). We are interested in the distribution of \\(Y = g\\left( X \\right)\\), where \\(g(X)\\) is a one-to-one transformationA function or method that turns one distribution into another defining a new random variable \\(Y\\). In this section we apply the following techniques for creating new families of distributions: (a) multiplication by a constant (b) raising to a power, (c) exponentiation and (d) mixing. 3.3.2 Multiplication by a Constant If claim data show change over time then such transformation can be useful to adjust for inflation. If the level of inflation is positive then claim costs are rising, and if it is negative then costs are falling. To adjust for inflation we multiply the cost \\(X\\) by 1+ inflation rate (negative inflation is deflation). To account for currency impact on claim costs we also use a transformation to apply currency conversion from a base to a counter currency. Consider the transformation \\(Y = cX\\), where \\(c &gt; 0\\), then the distribution function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[ F_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( Y \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( cX \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X \\leq \\frac{y}{c} \\right) = F_{X}\\left( \\frac{y}{c} \\right). \\] Hence, the probability density function of interest \\(f_{Y}(y)\\) can be written as \\[ f_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{1}{c}f_{X}\\left( \\frac{y}{c} \\right). \\] Suppose that \\(X\\) belongs to a certain set of parametric distributionsProbability distribution defined by a fixed set of parameters and define a rescaled version \\(Y\\ = \\ cX\\), \\(c\\ &gt; \\ 0\\). If \\(Y\\) is in the same set of distributions then the distribution is said to be a scale distributionA distribution with the property that multiplying all values by a constant leads to the same distribution family with only the scale parameter changed. When a member of a scale distribution is multiplied by a constant \\(c\\) (\\(c &gt; 0\\)), the scale parameter for this scale distribution meets two conditions: The parameter is changed by multiplying by \\(c\\); All other parameters remain unchanged. Example 3.3.1. Actuarial Exam Question. The aggregate losses of Eiffel Auto Insurance are denoted in Euro currency and follow a lognormal distribution with \\(\\mu = 8\\) and \\(\\sigma = 2\\). Given that 1 euro \\(=\\) 1.3 dollars, find the set of lognormal parameters which describe the distribution of Eiffel’s losses in dollars. Show Example Solution Solution. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) denote the aggregate losses of Eiffel Auto Insurance in euro currency and dollars respectively. As \\(Y = 1.3X\\), we have, \\[ F_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( Y \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( 1.3X \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X \\leq \\frac{y}{1.3} \\right) = F_{X}\\left( \\frac{y}{1.3} \\right). \\] \\(X\\) follows a lognormal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu = 8\\) and \\(\\sigma = 2\\). The probability density function of \\(X\\) is given by \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{1}{x \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp \\left\\{- \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{\\ln x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^{2}\\right\\} \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } x &gt; 0. \\] As \\(\\left| \\frac{dx}{dy} \\right| = \\frac{1}{1.3}\\), the probability density function of interest \\(f_{Y}(y)\\) is \\[ f_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{1}{1.3}f_{X}\\left( \\frac{y}{1.3} \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{1}{1.3}\\frac{1.3}{y \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp \\left\\{- \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{\\ln\\left( y/1.3 \\right) - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^{2}\\right\\} \\\\ = \\frac{1}{y \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp \\left\\{- \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{\\ln y - \\left( \\ln 1.3 + \\mu \\right)}{\\sigma} \\right)^{2}\\right\\}. \\] Then \\(Y\\) follows a lognormal distribution with parameters \\(\\ln 1.3 + \\mu = 8.26\\) and \\(\\sigma = 2.00\\). If we let \\(\\mu = ln(m)\\) then it can be easily seen that \\(m\\)=\\(e^{\\mu}\\) is the scale parameter which was multiplied by 1.3 while \\(\\sigma\\) is the shape parameter that remained unchanged. Example 3.3.2. Actuarial Exam Question. Demonstrate that the gamma distribution is a scale distribution. Show Example Solution Solution. Let \\(X\\sim Ga(\\alpha,\\theta)\\) and \\(Y = cX\\). As \\(\\left| \\frac{dx}{dy} \\right| = \\frac{1}{c}\\), then \\[ f_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{1}{c}f_{X}\\left( \\frac{y}{c} \\right) = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{y}{c\\theta} \\right)^{\\alpha}}{y~\\Gamma\\left( \\alpha \\right)}\\exp \\left( - \\frac{y}{c\\theta} \\right) . \\] We can see that \\(Y\\sim Ga(\\alpha,c\\theta)\\) indicating that gamma is a scale distribution and \\(\\theta\\) is a scale parameter. Using the same approach you can demonstrate that other distributions introduced in Section 3.2 are also scale distributions. In actuarial modeling, working with a scale distribution is very convenient because it allows to incorporate the effect of inflation and to accommodate changes in the currency unit. 3.3.3 Raising to a Power In Section 3.2.3 we talked about the flexibility of the Weibull distribution in fitting reliability dataA dataset consisting of failure times for failed units and run times for units still functioning. Looking to the origins of the Weibull distribution, we recognize that the Weibull is a power transformationA transformation type that involves raising a random variable to a power of the exponential distribution. This is an application of another type of transformation which involves raising the random variable to a power. Consider the transformation \\(Y = X^{\\tau}\\), where \\(\\tau &gt; 0\\), then the distribution function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[ F_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( Y \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X^{\\tau} \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X \\leq y^{1/ \\tau} \\right) = F_{X}\\left( y^{1/ \\tau} \\right). \\] Hence, the probability density function of interest \\(f_{Y}(y)\\) can be written as \\[ f_{Y}(y) = \\frac{1}{\\tau} y^{1/ \\tau - 1} f_{X}\\left( y^{1/ \\tau} \\right). \\] On the other hand, if \\(\\tau &lt; 0\\), then the distribution function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[ F_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( Y \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X^{\\tau} \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X \\geq y^{1/ \\tau} \\right) = 1 - F_{X}\\left( y^{1/ \\tau} \\right), \\] and \\[ f_{Y}(y) = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\right|{y^{1/ \\tau - 1}f}_{X}\\left( y^{1/ \\tau} \\right). \\] Example 3.3.3. We assume that \\(X\\) follows the exponential distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\) and consider the transformed variable \\(Y = X^{\\tau}\\). Show that \\(Y\\) follows the Weibull distribution when \\(\\tau\\) is positive and determine the parameters of the Weibull distribution. Show Example Solution Solution. As \\(X\\) follows the exponential distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\), we have \\[ f_{X}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\theta}e^{- x/ \\theta} \\ \\ \\ \\, x &gt; 0. \\] Solving for x yields \\(x = y^{1/\\tau}\\). Taking the derivative, we have \\[ \\left| \\frac{dx}{dy} \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\tau}{y^{\\frac{1}{\\tau}-1}}. \\] Thus, \\[ f_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\tau}{y^{\\frac{1}{\\tau} - 1}f}_{X}\\left( y^{\\frac{1}{\\tau}} \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{1}{\\tau \\theta }y^{\\frac{1}{\\tau} - 1}e^{- \\frac{y^{\\frac{1}{\\tau}}}{\\theta}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\left( \\frac{y}{\\beta} \\right)^{\\alpha - 1}e^{- \\left( y/ \\beta \\right)^{\\alpha}}. \\] where \\(\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\) and \\(\\beta = \\theta^{\\tau}\\). Then, \\(Y\\) follows the Weibull distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameter \\(\\beta\\). 3.3.4 Exponentiation The normal distribution is a very popular model for a wide number of applications and when the sample size is large, it can serve as an approximate distribution for other models. If the random variable \\(X\\) has a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\), then \\(Y = e^{X}\\) has lognormal distributionA heavy-tailed, positively skewed 2-parameter continuous distribution such that the natural log of the random variable is normally distributed with the same parameter values with parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^{2}\\). The lognormal random variable has a lower bound of zero, is positively skewed and has a long right tail. A lognormal distribution is commonly used to describe distributions of financial assets such as stock prices. It is also used in fitting claim amounts for automobile as well as health insurance. This is an example of another type of transformation which involves exponentiation. In general, consider the transformation \\(Y = e^{X}\\). Then, the distribution function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[F_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( Y \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( e^{X} \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X \\leq \\ln y \\right) = F_{X}\\left( \\ln y \\right).\\] Taking derivatives, we see that the probability density function of interest \\(f_{Y}(y)\\) can be written as \\[ f_{Y}(y) = \\frac{1}{y}f_{X}\\left( \\ln y \\right). \\] As an important special case, suppose that \\(X\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Then, the distribution of \\(Y = e^X\\) is \\[ f_{Y}(y) = \\frac{1}{y}f_{X}\\left( \\ln y \\right) = \\frac{1}{y\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{ \\ln y - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right\\}. \\] This is known as a lognormal distribution. Example 3.3.4. Actuarial Exam Question. Assume that \\(X\\) has a uniform distribution on the interval \\((0,\\ c)\\) and define \\(Y = e^{X}\\). Find the distribution of \\(Y\\). Show Example Solution Solution. We begin with the cdfCumulative distribution function of \\(Y\\), \\[ F_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( Y \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( e^{X} \\leq y \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X \\leq \\ln y \\right) = F_{X}\\left( \\ln y \\right). \\] Taking the derivative, we have, \\[ f_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{1}{y}f_{X}\\left(\\ln y \\right) = \\frac{1}{cy} . \\] Since \\(0 &lt; x &lt; c\\), then \\(1 &lt; y &lt; e^{c}\\). 3.3.5 Finite Mixtures Mixture distributions represent a useful way of modelling data that are drawn from a heterogeneous populationA dataset where the subpopulations are represented by separate distinct distributions. This parent population can be thought to be divided into multiple subpopulations with distinct distributions. 3.3.5.1 Two-point Mixture If the underlying phenomenon is diverse and can actually be described as two phenomena representing two subpopulations with different modes, we can construct the two point mixture random variable \\(X\\). Given random variables \\(X_{1}\\) and \\(X_{2}\\), with probability density functions \\(f_{X_{1}}\\left( x \\right)\\) and \\(f_{X_{2}}\\left( x \\right)\\) respectively, the probability density function of \\(X\\) is the weighted average of the component probability density function \\(f_{X_{1}}\\left( x \\right)\\) and \\(f_{X_{2}}\\left( x \\right)\\). The probability density function and distribution function of \\(X\\) are given by \\[f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = af_{X_{1}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - a \\right)f_{X_{2}}\\left( x \\right),\\] and \\[F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = aF_{X_{1}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - a \\right)F_{X_{2}}\\left( x \\right),\\] for \\(0 &lt; a &lt;1\\), where the mixing parametersProportion weight given to each subpopulation in a mixture \\(a\\) and \\((1 - a)\\) represent the proportions of data points that fall under each of the two subpopulations respectively. This weighted average can be applied to a number of other distribution related quantities. The k-th moment and moment generating function of \\(X\\) are given by \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = a\\mathrm{E}\\left( X_{1}^{K} \\right) + \\left( 1 - a \\right)\\mathrm{E}\\left( X_{2}^{k} \\right)\\), and \\[M_{X}(t) = aM_{X_{1}}(t) + \\left( 1 - a \\right)M_{X_{2}}(t),\\] respectively. Example 3.3.5. Actuarial Exam Question. A collection of insurance policies consists of two types. 25% of policies are Type 1 and 75% of policies are Type 2. For a policy of Type 1, the loss amount per year follows an exponential distribution with mean 200, and for a policy of Type 2, the loss amount per year follows a Pareto distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha=3\\) and \\(\\theta=200\\). For a policy chosen at random from the entire collection of both types of policies, find the probability that the annual loss will be less than 100, and find the average loss. Show Example Solution Solution. The two types of losses are the random variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\). \\(X_1\\) has an exponential distribution with mean 100, so \\(F_{X_1}\\left(100\\right)=1-e^{-\\frac{100}{200}}=0.393\\). \\(X_2\\) has a Pareto distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha=3\\) and \\(\\theta=200\\), so \\(F_{X_1}\\left(100\\right)=1-\\left(\\frac{200}{100+200}\\right)^3=0.704\\). Hence, \\(F_X\\left(100\\right)=\\left(0.25\\times0.393\\right)+\\left(0.75\\times0.704\\right)=0.626\\). The average loss is given by \\[\\mathrm{E}\\left(X\\right)=0.25\\mathrm{E}\\left(X_1\\right)+0.75\\mathrm{E}\\left(X_2\\right)=\\left(0.25\\times200\\right)+\\left(0.75\\times100\\right)=125\\]. 3.3.5.2 k-point Mixture In case of finite mixture distributions, the random variable of interest \\(X\\) has a probability \\(p_{i}\\) of being drawn from homogeneous subpopulation \\(i\\), where \\(i = 1,2,\\ldots,k\\) and \\(k\\) is the initially specified number of subpopulations in our mixture. The mixing parameter \\(p_{i}\\) represents the proportion of observations from subpopulation \\(i\\). Consider the random variable \\(X\\) generated from \\(k\\) distinct subpopulations, where subpopulation \\(i\\) is modeled by the continuous distribution \\(f_{X_{i}}\\left( x \\right)\\). The probability distribution of \\(X\\) is given by \\[f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{p_{i}f_{X_{i}}\\left( x \\right)},\\] where \\(0 &lt; p_{i} &lt; 1\\) and \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{k} p_{i} = 1\\). This model is often referred to as a finite mixtureA mixture distribution with a finite k number of subpopulations or a \\(k\\)-point mixture. The distribution function, \\(r\\)-th moment and moment generating functions of the \\(k\\)-th point mixture are given as \\[F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{p_{i}F_{X_{i}}\\left( x \\right)},\\] \\[\\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{r} \\right) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{p_{i}\\mathrm{E}\\left( X_{i}^{r} \\right)}, \\text{and}\\] \\[M_{X}(t) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{p_{i}M_{X_{i}}(t)},\\] respectively. Example 3.3.6. Actuarial Exam Question. \\(Y_{1}\\) is a mixture of \\(X_{1}\\) and \\(X_{2}\\) with mixing weights \\(a\\) and \\((1 - a)\\). \\(Y_{2}\\) is a mixture of \\(X_{3}\\) and \\(X_{4}\\) with mixing weights \\(b\\) and \\((1 - b)\\). \\(Z\\) is a mixture of \\(Y_{1}\\) and \\(Y_{2}\\) with mixing weights \\(c\\) and \\((1 - c)\\). Show that \\(Z\\) is a mixture of \\(X_{1}\\), \\(X_{2}\\), \\(X_{3}\\) and \\(X_{4}\\), and find the mixing weights. Show Example Solution Solution. Applying the formula for a mixed distribution, we get \\[f_{Y_{1}}\\left( x \\right) = af_{X_{1}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - a \\right)f_{X_{2}}\\left( x \\right)\\] \\[f_{Y_{2}}\\left( x \\right) = bf_{X_{3}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - b \\right)f_{X_{4}}\\left( x \\right)\\] \\[f_{Z}\\left( x \\right) = cf_{Y_{1}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - c \\right)f_{Y_{2}}\\left( x \\right)\\] Substituting the first two equations into the third, we get \\[f_{Z}\\left( x \\right) = c\\left\\lbrack af_{X_{1}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - a \\right)f_{X_{2}}\\left( x \\right) \\right\\rbrack + \\left( 1 - c \\right)\\left\\lbrack bf_{X_{3}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - b \\right)f_{X_{4}}\\left( x \\right) \\right\\rbrack\\] \\[= caf_{X_{1}}\\left( x \\right) + c\\left( 1 - a \\right)f_{X_{2}}\\left( x \\right) + \\left( 1 - c \\right)bf_{X_{3}}\\left( x \\right) + (1 - c)\\left( 1 - b \\right)f_{X_{4}}\\left( x \\right)\\]. Then, \\(Z\\) is a mixture of \\(X_{1}\\), \\(X_{2}\\), \\(X_{3}\\) and \\(X_{4}\\), with mixing weights \\(\\text{ca}\\), \\(c\\left( 1 - a \\right)\\), \\(\\left( 1 - c \\right)b\\) and \\((1 - c)\\left( 1 - b \\right)\\), respectively. It can be easily seen that the mixing weights sum to one. 3.3.6 Continuous Mixtures A mixture with a very large number of subpopulations (\\(k\\) goes to infinity) is often referred to as a continuous mixtureA mixture distribution with an infinite number of subpopulations, where the mixing parameter is itself a continuous distribution. In a continuous mixture, subpopulations are not distinguished by a discrete mixing parameter but by a continuous variable \\(\\Theta\\), where \\(\\Theta\\) plays the role of \\(p_{i}\\) in the finite mixture. Consider the random variable \\(X\\) with a distribution depending on a parameter \\(\\Theta\\), where \\(\\Theta\\) itself is a continuous random variable. This description yields the following model for \\(X\\) \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{f_{X}\\left(x \\left| \\theta \\right. \\right)g_{\\Theta}( \\theta )} d \\theta , \\] where \\(f_{X}\\left( x | \\theta \\right)\\) is the conditional distributionA probability distribution that applies to a subpopulation satisfying the condition of \\(X\\) at a particular value of \\(\\Theta=\\theta\\) and \\(g_{\\Theta}\\left( \\theta \\right)\\) is the probability statement made about the unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). In a Bayesian context (described in Section 4.4), this is known as the prior distributionA probability distribution assigned prior to observing additional data of \\(\\Theta\\) (the prior information or expert opinion to be used in the analysis). The distribution function, \\(k\\)-th moment and moment generating functions of the continuous mixture are given as \\[ F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{F_{X}\\left(x \\left| \\theta \\right. \\right) g_{\\Theta}(\\theta)} d \\theta, \\] \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k}\\left| \\theta \\right. \\right)g_{\\Theta}(\\theta)}d \\theta, \\] \\[ M_{X}(t) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( e^{t X} \\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\\mathrm{E}\\left( e^{ tx}\\left| \\theta \\right. \\right)g_{\\Theta}(\\theta)}d \\theta, \\] respectively. The \\(k\\)-th moment of the mixture distribution can be rewritten as \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k} \\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k}\\left| \\theta \\right. \\right)g_{\\Theta}(\\theta)}d\\theta ~=~ \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( X^{k}\\left| \\Theta \\right. \\right) \\right\\rbrack . \\] Using the law of iterated expectations (see Appendix Chapter 16), we can define the mean and variance of \\(X\\) as \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( X\\left| \\Theta \\right. \\right) \\right\\rbrack \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{Var}\\left( X\\left| \\Theta \\right. \\right) \\right\\rbrack + \\mathrm{Var}\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( X\\left| \\Theta \\right. \\right) \\right\\rbrack . \\] Example 3.3.7. Actuarial Exam Question. \\(X\\) has a normal distribution with a mean of \\(\\Lambda\\) and variance of 1. \\(\\Lambda\\) has a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and variance of 1. Find the mean and variance of \\(X\\). Show Example Solution Solution. X is a continuous mixture with mean \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left(X\\right)=\\mathrm{E}\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\left(X\\middle|\\Lambda\\right)\\right]=\\mathrm{E}\\left(\\Lambda\\right)=1 \\text{ and } \\mathrm{V}\\left(X\\right)=\\mathrm{V}\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\left(X\\middle|\\Lambda\\right)\\right]+\\mathrm{E}\\left[\\mathrm{V}\\left(X\\middle|\\Lambda\\right)\\right]=\\mathrm{V}\\left(\\Lambda\\right)+\\mathrm{E}\\left(1\\right)=1+1=2. \\] Example 3.3.8. Actuarial Exam Question. Claim sizes, \\(X\\), are uniform on the interval \\(\\left(\\Theta,\\Theta+10\\right)\\) for each policyholder. \\(\\Theta\\) varies by policyholder according to an exponential distribution with mean 5. Find the unconditional distributionA probability distribution independent of any another imposed conditions, mean and variance of \\(X\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The conditional distribution of \\(X\\) is \\(f_{X}\\left( \\left. \\ x \\right|\\theta \\right) = \\frac{1}{10}\\) for \\(\\theta &lt; x &lt; \\theta + 10\\). The prior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(g_{\\Theta}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{5}e^{- \\frac{\\theta}{5}}\\) for \\(0 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\infty\\). The conditional mean and variance of \\(X\\) are given by \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\left. \\ X \\right|\\theta \\right) = \\frac{\\theta + \\theta + 10}{2} = \\theta + 5 \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\left. \\ X \\right|\\theta \\right) = \\frac{\\left\\lbrack \\left( \\theta + 10 \\right) - \\theta \\right\\rbrack^{2}}{12} = \\frac{100}{12}, \\] respectively. Hence, the unconditional mean and variance of \\(X\\) are given by \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( X\\left| \\Theta \\right. \\right) \\right\\rbrack = \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\Theta + 5 \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\Theta \\right) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10, \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var}\\left( X \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack V\\left( X\\left| \\Theta \\right. \\right) \\right\\rbrack + \\mathrm{Var}\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( X\\left| \\Theta \\right. \\right) \\right\\rbrack \\\\ = \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\frac{100}{12} \\right) + \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\Theta + 5 \\right) = 8.33 + \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\Theta \\right) = 33.33. \\] The unconditional distribution of \\(X\\) is \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\int f_{X}\\left( x |\\theta \\right) ~g_{\\Theta}(\\theta) d \\theta . \\] \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\int_{0}^{x}{\\frac{1}{50}e^{- \\frac{\\theta}{5}}d\\theta = \\frac{1}{10}\\left( 1 - e^{- \\frac{x}{5}} \\right)} &amp; 0 \\leq x \\leq 10, \\\\ \\int_{x - 10}^{x}{\\frac{1}{50}e^{- \\frac{\\theta}{5}} d\\theta} = \\frac{1}{10}\\left( e^{- \\frac{\\left( x - 10 \\right)}{5}} - e^{- \\frac{x}{5}} \\right) &amp; 10 &lt; x &lt; \\infty. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] Show Quiz Solution 3.4 Coverage Modifications In this section we evaluate the impacts of coverage modifications: a) deductibles, b) policy limit, c) coinsurance and inflation on insurer’s costs. 3.4.1 Policy Deductibles Under an ordinary deductible policy, the insured (policyholder) agrees to cover a fixed amount of an insurance claim before the insurer starts to pay. This fixed expense paid out of pocket is called the deductible and often denoted by \\(d\\). If the loss exceeds \\(d\\) then the insurer is responsible for covering the loss X less the deductible \\(d\\). Depending on the agreement, the deductible may apply to each covered loss or to the total losses during a defined benefit period (month, year, etc.) Deductibles eliminate a large number of small claims, reduce costs of handling and processing these claims, reduce premiums for the policyholders and reduce moral hazardSituation where an insured is more likely to be risk seeking if they do not bear sufficient consequences for a loss. Moral hazard occurs when the insured takes more risks, increasing the chances of loss due to perils insured against, knowing that the insurer will incur the cost (e.g. a policyholder with collision insurance may be encouraged to drive recklessly). The larger the deductible, the less the insured pays in premiums for an insurance policy. Let \\(X\\) denote the loss incurred to the insured and \\(Y\\) denote the amount of paid claim by the insurer. Speaking of the benefit paid to the policyholder, we differentiate between two variables: The payment per loss and the payment per payment. The payment per lossAmount insurer pays when a loss occurs and can be 0 variable, denoted by \\(Y^{L}\\) or \\((X-d)_+\\) is left censoredValues below a threshold d are not ignored but converted to 0 because values of \\(X\\) that are less than \\(d\\) are not ignored but are set equal to zero. This variable includes losses for which a payment is made as well as losses less than the deductible and hence is defined as \\[ Y^{L} = \\left( X - d \\right)_{+} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; X &lt; d, \\\\ X - d &amp; X &gt; d \\end{array} \\right. . \\] \\(Y^{L}\\) is often referred to as left censored and shifted variable because the values below \\(d\\) are not ignored and all losses are shifted by a value \\(d\\). On the other hand, the payment per paymentAmount insurer pays given a payment is needed and is greater than 0 variable, denoted by \\(Y^{P}\\), is defined only when there is a payment. Specifically, \\(Y^P\\) equals \\(X-d\\) on the event \\(\\{X &gt;d\\}\\), denoted as \\(Y^P = X-d ||X&gt;d\\). Another way of expressing this that is commonly used is \\[ Y^{P} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Undefined} &amp; X \\le d \\\\ X - d &amp; X &gt; d \\end{matrix} . \\right. \\] Here, \\(Y^{P}\\) is often referred to as left truncatedValues below a threshold d are not reported and unknown and shifted variable or excess loss variable because the claims smaller than \\(d\\) are not reported and values above \\(d\\) are shifted by \\(d\\). Even when the distribution of \\(X\\) is continuous, the distribution of \\(Y^{L}\\) is a hybrid combination of discrete and continuous components. The discrete part of the distribution is concentrated at \\(Y = 0\\) (when \\(X \\leq d\\)) and the continuous part is spread over the interval \\(Y &gt; 0\\) (when \\(X &gt; d\\)). For the discrete part, the probability that no payment is made is the probability that losses fall below the deductible; that is, \\[\\Pr\\left( Y^{L} = 0 \\right) = \\Pr\\left( X \\leq d \\right) = F_{X}\\left( d \\right).\\] Using the transformation \\(Y^{L} = X - d\\) for the continuous part of the distribution, we can find the probability density function of \\(Y^{L}\\) given by \\[f_{Y^{L}}\\left( y \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} F_{X}\\left( d \\right) &amp; y = 0, \\\\ f_{X}\\left( y + d \\right) &amp; y &gt; 0 \\end{matrix} \\right. \\] We can see that the payment per payment variable is the payment per loss variable conditioned on the loss exceeding the deductible; that is, \\(Y^{P} = \\left. \\ Y^{L} \\right|X &gt; d\\). Hence, the probability density function of \\(Y^{P}\\) is given by \\[f_{Y^{P}}\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{f_{X}\\left( y + d \\right)}{1 - F_{X}\\left( d \\right)},\\] for \\(y &gt; 0\\). Accordingly, the distribution functions of \\(Y^{L}\\)and \\(Y^{P}\\) are given by \\[F_{Y^{L}}\\left( y \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} F_{X}\\left( d \\right) &amp; y = 0, \\\\ F_{X}\\left( y + d \\right) &amp; y &gt; 0. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] and \\[F_{Y^{P}}\\left( y \\right) = \\frac{F_{X}\\left( y + d \\right) - F_{X}\\left( d \\right)}{1 - F_{X}\\left( d \\right)},\\] for \\(y &gt; 0\\), respectively. The raw moments of \\(Y^{L}\\) and \\(Y^{P}\\) can be found directly using the probability density function of \\(X\\) as follows \\[\\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{L} \\right)^{k} \\right\\rbrack = \\int_{d}^{\\infty}\\left( x - d \\right)^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right)dx ,\\] and \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{P} \\right)^{k} \\right\\rbrack = \\frac{\\int_{d}^{\\infty}\\left( x - d \\right)^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right) dx }{{1 - F}_{X}\\left( d \\right)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{L} \\right)^{k} \\right\\rbrack}{{1 - F}_{X}\\left( d \\right)}, \\] respectively. For \\(k=1\\), we can use the survival function to calculate \\(\\mathrm{E}(Y^L)\\) as \\[ \\mathrm{E}(Y^L) = \\int_d^{\\infty} [1-F_X(x)] ~dx . \\] This could be easily proved if we start with the initial definition of \\(\\mathrm{E}(Y^L)\\) and use integration by parts. We have seen that the deductible \\(d\\) imposed on an insurance policy is the amount of loss that has to be paid out of pocket before the insurer makes any payment. The deductible \\(d\\) imposed on an insurance policy reduces the insurer’s payment. The loss elimination ratio (LER)% decrease of the expected payment by the insurer as a result of the deductible is the percentage decrease in the expected payment of the insurer as a result of imposing the deductible. LER is defined as \\[LER = \\frac{\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) - \\mathrm{E}\\left( Y^{L} \\right)}{\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right)}.\\] A little less common type of policy deductible is the franchise deductible. The franchise deductibleInsurer pays nothing for losses below the deductible, but pays the full amount for any loss above the deductible will apply to the policy in the same way as ordinary deductible except that when the loss exceeds the deductible \\(d\\), the full loss is covered by the insurer. The payment per loss and payment per payment variables are defined as \\[Y^{L} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; X \\leq d, \\\\ X &amp; X &gt; d, \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] and \\[Y^{P} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Undefined} &amp; X \\leq d, \\\\ X &amp; X &gt; d, \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] respectively. Example 3.4.1. Actuarial Exam Question. A claim severity distribution is exponential with mean 1000. An insurance company will pay the amount of each claim in excess of a deductible of 100. Calculate the variance of the amount paid by the insurance company for one claim, including the possibility that the amount paid is 0. Show Example Solution Solution. Let \\(Y^{L}\\) denote the amount paid by the insurance company for one claim. \\[Y^{L} = \\left( X - 100 \\right)_{+} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; X \\leq 100, \\\\ X - 100 &amp; X &gt; 100. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] The first and second moments of \\(Y^{L}\\) are \\[E\\left( Y^{L} \\right) = \\int_{100}^{\\infty}\\left( x - 100 \\right)f_{X}\\left( x \\right)dx \\\\ = {\\int_{100}^{\\infty}{S_{X}\\left( x \\right)}dx = 1000e}^{- \\frac{100}{1000}},\\] and \\[E\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{L} \\right)^{2} \\right\\rbrack = \\int_{100}^{\\infty}\\left( x - 100 \\right)^{2}f_{X}\\left( x \\right)dx \\\\\\\\ = 2 \\times 1000^{2}e^{- \\frac{100}{1000}}.\\] So, \\[\\mathrm{Var}\\left( Y^{L} \\right) = \\left( 2 \\times 1000^{2}e^{- \\frac{100}{1000}} \\right) - \\left( {1000e}^{- \\frac{100}{1000}} \\right)^{2} = 990,944.\\] An arguably simpler path to the solution is to make use of the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y^{P}\\). If \\(X\\) is exponentially distributed with mean 1000, then \\(Y^{P}\\) is also exponentially distributed with the same mean, because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. Hence, \\(E\\left( Y^{P} \\right)\\)=1000 and \\[E\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{P} \\right)^{2} \\right\\rbrack = 2 \\times 1000^{2}.\\] Using the relationship between \\(Y^{L}\\) and \\(Y^{P}\\) we find \\[E\\left( Y^{L} \\right) = \\ E\\left( Y^{P} \\right)S_{X}\\left( 100 \\right){= 1000e}^{- \\frac{100}{1000}}\\] \\[E\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{L} \\right)^{2} \\right\\rbrack = E\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{P} \\right)^{2} \\right\\rbrack S_{X}\\left( 100 \\right) = 2 \\times 1000^{2}e^{- \\frac{100}{1000}}.\\] The relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y^P\\) can also be used when dealing with the uniform or the Pareto distributions. You can easily show that if \\(X\\) is uniform over the interval \\(\\left(0,\\theta\\right)\\) then \\(Y^P\\) is uniform over the interval \\(\\left(0,\\theta-d\\right)\\) and if \\(X\\) is Pareto with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\) then \\(Y^P\\) is Pareto with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta+d\\). Example 3.4.2. Actuarial Exam Question. For an insurance: Losses have a density function \\[f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0.02x &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; 10, \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{elsewhere.} \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right. \\] The insurance has an ordinary deductible of 4 per loss. \\(Y^{P}\\) is the claim payment per payment random variable. Calculate \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y^{P} \\right)\\). Show Example Solution Solution. We define \\(Y^P\\) as follows \\[Y^{P} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Undefined} &amp; X \\leq 4, \\\\ X - 4 &amp; X &gt; 4. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] So, \\(E\\left( Y^{P} \\right) = \\frac{\\int_{4}^{10}\\left( x - 4 \\right)0.02xdx}{{1 - F}_{X}\\left( 4 \\right)} = \\frac{2.88}{0.84} = 3.43\\). Note that we divide by \\(S_X(4)=1-F_X(4)\\), as this is the range where the variable \\(Y^P\\) is defined. Example 3.4.3. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given: Losses follow an exponential distribution with the same mean in all years. The loss elimination ratio this year is 70%. The ordinary deductible for the coming year is 4/3 of the current deductible. Compute the loss elimination ratio for the coming year. Show Example Solution Solution. Let the losses \\(X\\sim Exp(\\theta)\\) and the deductible for the coming year \\(d&#39; = \\frac{4}{3}d\\), the deductible of the current year. The LER for the current year is \\[\\frac{E\\left( X \\right) - E\\left( Y^{L} \\right)}{E\\left( X \\right)} = \\frac{\\theta - \\theta e^{- d / \\theta}}{\\theta} = 1 - e^{- d / \\theta} = 0.7.\\] Then, \\(e^{- d / \\theta} = 0.3\\). The LER for the coming year is \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\frac{\\theta - \\theta \\exp(- \\frac{d&#39;}{\\theta})}{\\theta}=\\frac{\\theta - \\theta \\exp(- \\frac{\\left( \\frac{4}{3}d \\right)}{\\theta})}{\\theta} \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\exp\\left(- \\frac{ \\frac{4}{3} d }{\\theta}\\right) = 1 - \\left( e^{-d /\\theta} \\right)^{4/3} = 1 - {0.3}^{4/3} = 0.8 . \\end{align*}\\] 3.4.2 Policy Limits Under a limited policy, the insurer is responsible for covering the actual loss \\(X\\) up to the limit of its coverage. This fixed limit of coveragePolicy limit, or maximum contractual financial obligation of the insurer for a loss is called the policy limit and often denoted by \\(u\\). If the loss exceeds the policy limit, the difference \\(X - u\\) has to be paid by the policyholder. While a higher policy limit means a higher payout to the insured, it is associated with a higher premium. Let \\(X\\) denote the loss incurred to the insured and \\(Y\\) denote the amount of paid claim by the insurer. The variable \\(Y\\) known as the limited loss variable and denoted by \\(X \\land u\\). It is a right censored variableValues above a threshold u are not ignored but converted to u because values above \\(u\\) are set equal to \\(u\\). The limited loss random variable \\(Y\\) is defined as \\[ Y = X \\land u = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} X &amp; X \\leq u, \\\\ u &amp; X &gt; u. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] It can be seen that the distinction between \\(Y^{L}\\) and \\(Y^{P}\\) is not needed under limited policy as the insurer will always make a payment. Using the definitions of \\(\\left(X-d\\right)_+ \\text{ and } \\left(X\\land d\\right)\\), it can be easily seen that the expected payment without any coverage modification, \\(X\\), is equal to the sum of the expected payments with deductible \\(d\\) and limit \\(d\\). That is, \\({X=\\left(X-d\\right)}_++ \\left(X\\land d\\right)\\). When a loss is subject to a deductible \\(d\\) and a limit \\(u\\), the per-loss variable \\(Y^L\\) is defined as \\[ Y^{L} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; X \\leq d, \\\\ X - d &amp; d &lt; X \\leq u, \\\\ u - d &amp; X &gt; u. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] Hence, \\(Y^L\\) can be expressed as \\(Y^L=\\left(X\\land u\\right)-\\left(X\\land d\\right)\\). Even when the distribution of \\(X\\) is continuous, the distribution of \\(Y\\) is a hybrid combination of discrete and continuous components. The discrete part of the distribution is concentrated at \\(Y = u\\) (when \\(X &gt; u\\)), while the continuous part is spread over the interval \\(Y &lt; u\\) (when \\(X \\leq u\\)). For the discrete part, the probability that the benefit paid is \\(u\\), is the probability that the loss exceeds the policy limit \\(u\\); that is, \\[\\Pr \\left( Y = u \\right) = \\Pr \\left( X &gt; u \\right) = {1 - F}_{X}\\left( u \\right).\\] For the continuous part of the distribution \\(Y = X\\), hence the probability density function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[f_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} f_{X}\\left( y \\right) &amp; 0 &lt; y &lt; u, \\\\ 1 - F_{X}\\left( u \\right) &amp; y = u. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] Accordingly, the distribution function of \\(Y\\) is given by \\[F_{Y}\\left( y \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} F_{X}\\left( x \\right) &amp; 0 &lt; y &lt; u, \\\\ 1 &amp; y \\geq u. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] The raw moments of \\(Y\\) can be found directly using the probability density function of \\(X\\) as follows \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( Y^{k} \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( X \\land u \\right)^{k} \\right\\rbrack = \\int_{0}^{u}x^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right)dx + \\int_{u}^{\\infty}{u^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right)} dx \\\\ = \\int_{0}^{u}x^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right)dx + u^{k}\\left\\lbrack {1 - F}_{X}\\left( u \\right) \\right\\rbrack . \\] For \\(k=1\\), we can use the survival function to calculate \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y \\right)\\) as follows \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( Y \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land u \\right) = \\int_{0}^{u} [1-F_{X}(x) ]dx . \\] This could be easily proved if we start with the initial definition of \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y \\right)\\) and use integration by parts. Example 3.4.4. Actuarial Exam Question. Under a group insuranceInsurance provided to groups of people to take advantage of lower administrative costs vs. individual policies policy, an insurer agrees to pay 100% of the medical bills incurred during the year by employees of a small company, up to a maximum total of one million dollars. The total amount of bills incurred, \\(X\\), has probability density function \\[f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\frac{x\\left( 4 - x \\right)}{9} &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; 3, \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{elsewhere.} \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] where \\(x\\) is measured in millions. Calculate the total amount, in millions of dollars, the insurer would expect to pay under this policy. Show Example Solution Solution. Define the total amount of bills paid by the insurer as \\[Y = X \\land 1 = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} X &amp; X \\leq 1, \\\\ 1 &amp; X &gt; 1. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] So \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land 1 \\right) = \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{2}(4 - x)}{9}dx + 1 * \\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{x\\left( 4 - x \\right)}{9}dx = 0.935\\). 3.4.3 Coinsurance and Inflation As we have seen in Section 3.4.1, the amount of loss retained by the policyholder can be losses up to the deductible \\(d\\). The retained loss can also be a percentage of the claim. The percentage \\(\\alpha\\), often referred to as the coinsurance factor, is the percentage of claim the insurance company is required to cover. If the policy is subject to an ordinary deductible and policy limit, coinsurance refers to the percentage of claim the insurer is required to cover, after imposing the ordinary deductible and policy limit. The payment per loss variable, \\(Y^{L}\\), is defined as \\[ Y^{L} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; X \\leq d, \\\\ \\alpha\\left( X - d \\right) &amp; d &lt; X \\leq u, \\\\ \\alpha\\left( u - d \\right) &amp; X &gt; u. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] The policy limit (the maximum amount paid by the insurer) in this case is \\(\\alpha\\left( u - d \\right)\\), while \\(u\\) is the maximum covered loss. We have seen in Section 3.4.2 that when a loss is subject to both a deductible \\(d\\) and a limit \\(u\\) the per-loss variable \\(Y^L\\) can be expressed as \\(Y^L=\\left(X\\land u\\right)-\\left(X\\land d\\right)\\). With coinsurance, this becomes \\(Y^L\\) can be expressed as \\(Y^L=\\alpha\\left[(X\\land u)-(X\\land d)\\right]\\). The \\(k\\)-th moment of \\(Y^{L}\\) is given by \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{L} \\right)^{k} \\right\\rbrack = \\int_{d}^{u}\\left\\lbrack \\alpha\\left( x - d \\right) \\right\\rbrack^{k}f_{X}\\left( x \\right)dx + \\left\\lbrack \\alpha\\left( u - d \\right) \\right\\rbrack^{k} [1-F_{X}\\left( u \\right)] . \\] A growth factorMultiplicative factor applied to a distribution to account for the impact of inflation, typically (1+rate) \\(\\left( 1 + r \\right)\\) may be applied to \\(X\\) resulting in an inflated loss random variable \\(\\left( 1 + r \\right)X\\) (the prespecified d and u remain unchanged). The resulting per loss variable can be written as \\[Y^{L} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; X \\leq \\frac{d}{1 + r}, \\\\ \\alpha\\left\\lbrack \\left( 1 + r \\right)X - d \\right\\rbrack &amp; \\frac{d}{1 + r} &lt; X \\leq \\frac{u}{1 + r}, \\\\ \\alpha\\left( u - d \\right) &amp; X &gt; \\frac{u}{1 + r}. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] The first and second moments of \\(Y^{L}\\) can be expressed as \\[\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y^{L} \\right) = \\alpha\\left( 1 + r \\right)\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land \\frac{u}{1 + r} \\right) - \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land \\frac{d}{1 + r} \\right) \\right\\rbrack,\\] and \\[\\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( Y^{L} \\right)^{2} \\right\\rbrack = \\alpha^{2}\\left( 1 + r \\right)^{2} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( X \\land \\frac{u}{1 + r} \\right)^{2} \\right\\rbrack - \\mathrm{E}\\left\\lbrack \\left( X \\land \\frac{d}{1 + r} \\right)^{2} \\right\\rbrack \\right. \\\\ \\left. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ - 2\\left( \\frac{d}{1 + r} \\right)\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land \\frac{u}{1 + r} \\right) - \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land \\frac{d}{1 + r} \\right) \\right\\rbrack \\right\\} ,\\] respectively. The formulas given for the first and second moments of \\(Y^{L}\\) are general. Under full coverage, \\(\\alpha = 1\\), \\(r = 0\\), \\(u = \\infty\\), \\(d = 0\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y^{L} \\right)\\) reduces to \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right)\\). If only an ordinary deductible is imposed, \\(\\alpha = 1\\), \\(r = 0\\), \\(u = \\infty\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y^{L} \\right)\\) reduces to \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\right) - \\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land d \\right)\\). If only a policy limit is imposed \\(\\alpha = 1\\), \\(r = 0\\), \\(d = 0\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( Y^{L} \\right)\\) reduces to \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( X \\land u \\right)\\). Example 3.4.5. Actuarial Exam Question. The ground up loss random variable for a health insurance policy in 2006 is modeled with X, an exponential distribution with mean 1000. An insurance policy pays the loss above an ordinary deductible of 100, with a maximum annual payment of 500. The ground up loss random variable is expected to be 5% larger in 2007, but the insurance in 2007 has the same deductible and maximum payment as in 2006. Find the percentage increase in the expected cost per payment from 2006 to 2007. Show Example Solution Solution. We define the amount per loss \\(Y^L\\) in both years as \\[Y_{2006}^{L} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; X \\leq 100, \\\\ X - 100 &amp; 100 &lt; X \\leq 600, \\\\ 500 &amp; X &gt; 600. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] \\[Y_{2007}^{L} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; X \\leq 95.24, \\\\ 1.05X - 100 &amp; 95.24 &lt; X \\leq 571.43, \\\\ 500 &amp; X &gt; 571.43. \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\] So, \\[E\\left( Y_{2006}^{L} \\right) = E\\left( X \\land 600 \\right) - E\\left( X \\land 100 \\right) = 1000\\left( {1 - e}^{- \\frac{600}{1000}} \\right) - 1000\\left( {1 - e}^{- \\frac{100}{1000}} \\right)\\] \\[= 356.026\\]. \\[E\\left( Y_{2007}^{L} \\right) = 1.05\\left\\lbrack E\\left( X \\land 571.43 \\right) - E\\left( X \\land 95.24 \\right) \\right\\rbrack\\] \\[ = 1.05\\left\\lbrack 1000\\left( {1 - e}^{- \\frac{571.43}{1000}} \\right) - 1000\\left( {1 - e}^{- \\frac{95.24}{1000}} \\right) \\right\\rbrack \\] \\[=361.659\\]. \\(E\\left( Y_{2006}^{P} \\right) = \\frac{356.026}{e^{- \\frac{100}{1000}}} = 393.469\\). \\(E\\left( Y_{2007}^{P} \\right) = \\frac{361.659}{e^{- \\frac{95.24}{1000}}} = 397.797\\). Because \\(\\frac{E\\left( Y_{2007}^{P} \\right)}{E\\left( Y_{2006}^{P} \\right)} -1 = 0.011,\\) there is an increase of 1.1% from 2006 to 2007. Due to the policy limit, the cost per payment event grew by only 1.1% between 2006 and 2007 even though the ground up losses increased by 5% between the two years. 3.4.4 Reinsurance In Section 3.4.1 we introduced the policy deductible, which is a contractual arrangement under which an insured transfers part of the risk by securing coverage from an insurer in return for an insurance premium. Under that policy, the insured must pay all losses up to the deductible, and the insurer only pays the amount (if any) above the deductible. We now introduce reinsuranceA transaction where the primary insurer buys insurance from a re-insurer who will cover part of the losses and/or loss adjustment expenses of the primary insurer, a mechanism of insurance for insurance companies. Reinsurance is a contractual arrangement under which an insurer transfers part of the underlying insured risk by securing coverage from another insurer (referred to as a reinsurer) in return for a reinsurance premium. Although reinsurance involves a relationship between three parties: the original insured, the insurer (often referred to as cedentParty that is transferring the risk to a reinsurer or cedant) and the reinsurer, the parties of the reinsurance agreement are only the primary insurer and the reinsurer. There is no contractual agreement between the original insured and the reinsurer. Though many different types of reinsurance contracts exist, a common form is excess of loss coverageContract where an insurer pays all claims up to a specified amount and then the reinsurer pays claims in excess of stated reinsurance deductible. In such contracts, the primary insurer must make all required payments to the insured until the primary insurer’s total payments reach a fixed reinsurance deducible. The reinsurer is then only responsible for paying losses above the reinsurance deductible. The maximum amount retained by the primary insurer in the reinsurance agreement (the reinsurance deductible) is called retentionMaximum amount payable by the primary insurer in a reinsurance arrangement . Reinsurance arrangements allow insurers with limited financial resources to increase the capacity to write insurance and meet client requests for larger insurance coverage while reducing the impact of potential losses and protecting the insurance company against catastrophic losses. Reinsurance also allows the primary insurer to benefit from underwriting skills, expertise and proficient complex claim file handling of the larger reinsurance companies. Example 3.4.6. Actuarial Exam Question. Losses arising in a certain portfolio have a two-parameter Pareto distribution with \\(\\alpha=5\\) and \\(\\theta=3,600\\). A reinsurance arrangement has been made, under which (a) the reinsurer accepts 15% of losses up to \\(u=5,000\\) and all amounts in excess of 5,000 and (b) the insurer pays for the remaining losses. Express the random variables for the reinsurer’s and the insurer’s payments as a function of \\(X\\), the portfolio losses. Calculate the mean amount paid on a single claim by the insurer. By assuming that the upper limit is \\(u = \\infty\\), calculate an upper bound on the standard deviation of the amount paid on a single claim by the insurer (retaining the 15% copayment). Show Example Solution Solution. a). The reinsurer’s portion is \\[ Y_{reinsurer} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0.15 X &amp; X &lt; 5000, \\\\ 0.15(5000) + X-5000 &amp; X \\ge 5000 \\end{array} \\right. . \\] and the insurer’s portion is \\[ Y_{insurer} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0.85 X &amp; X &lt; 5000, \\\\ 0.85(5000) &amp; X \\ge 5000 \\end{array} \\right. = 0.85(X \\wedge 5000). \\] b) Using the limited expected value tables for the Pareto distribution, we have \\[ \\mathrm{E}~Y_{insurer} = 0.85~\\mathrm{E}~(X \\wedge 5000)= 0.85~\\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha-1}\\left[ 1- \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{5000+\\theta}\\right)^{\\alpha-1} \\right] \\\\ = 0.85~\\frac{3600}{5-1}\\left[ 1- \\left(\\frac{3600}{5000+3600}\\right)^{5-1}\\right] = 741.5103. \\] For the first moment of the unlimited variable, we have \\[ \\mathrm{E}~Y_{insurer}(u=\\infty) = 0.85~\\mathrm{E}~X = 0.85~\\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha-1} = 0.85~\\frac{3600}{5-1} = 765. \\] For the second moment of the unlimited variable, we use the table of distributions to get \\[ \\mathrm{E}~Y_{insurer}(u=\\infty)^2 = 0.85^2~\\mathrm{E}~X^2 = 0.85^2~\\frac{\\theta^2 \\Gamma(2+1)\\Gamma(\\alpha-2)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\\\ = 0.85^2~\\frac{3600^2 *2*2}{24} = 1560600. \\] Thus, the variance is \\(1560600-765^2 =975375.\\) Alternatively, you can use the formula \\[ 0.85^2~\\mathrm{Var}~X = 0.85^2~\\frac{\\alpha \\theta^2}{(\\alpha-1)^2(\\alpha-2)} \\\\ = 0.85^2~\\frac{5(3600^2)}{(5-1)^2(5-2)} = 975375 . \\] Taking square roots, the standard deviation is \\(\\sqrt{975375} \\approx 987.6108\\). Further discussions of reinsurance will be provided in Section 10.4. Show Quiz Solution 3.5 Maximum Likelihood Estimation In this section, you learn how to: Define a likelihood for a sample of observations from a continuous distribution Define the maximum likelihood estimator for a random sample of observations from a continuous distribution Estimate parametric distributions based on grouped, censored, and truncated data 3.5.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimators for Complete Data Up to this point, the chapter has focused on parametric distributions that are commonly used in insurance applications. However, to be useful in applied work, these distributions must use “realistic” values for the parameters and for this we turn to data. At a foundational level, we assume that the analyst has available a random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) from a distribution with distribution function \\(F_X\\) (for brevity, we sometimes drop the subscript \\(X\\)). As is common, we use the vector \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) to denote the set of parameters for \\(F\\).This basic sample scheme is reviewed in Appendix Section 15.1. Although basic, this sampling scheme provides the foundations for understanding more complex schemes that are regularly used in practice, and so it is important to master the basics. Before a draw from a distribution, we consider potential outcomes summarized by the random variable \\(X_i\\) (here, \\(i\\) is 1, 2, …, \\(n\\)). After the draw, we observe \\(x_i\\). Notationally, we use upper case roman letters for random variables and lower case ones for realizations. We have seen this set-up already in Section 2.4, where we used \\(\\Pr(X_1 =x_1, \\ldots, X_n=x_n)\\) to quantify the “likelihood” of drawing a sample \\(\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\). With continuous data, we use the joint probability density function (pdf) instead of joint probabilities. With the independence assumption, the joint pdf may be written as the product of pdfs. Thus, we define the likelihood to be \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i) . \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] From the notation, note that we consider this to be a function of the parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), with the data \\(\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\) held fixed. The maximum likelihood estimator is that value of the parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) that maximize \\(L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). From calculus, we know that maximizing a function produces the same results as maximizing the logarithm of a function (this is because the logarithm is a monotone, convex function). Because we get the same results, to ease computation considerations, it is common to consider the logarithmic likelihood, denoted as \\[\\begin{equation} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\ln L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln f(x_i) . \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Example 3.5.1. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given the following five observations: 521, 658, 702, 819, 1217. You use the single-parameter Pareto with cumulative distribution function: \\[ F(x) = 1- \\left(\\frac{500}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}, ~~~~ x&gt;500 . \\] With \\(n=5\\), the log-likelihood function is \\[ l(\\alpha|\\mathbf{x} ) = \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln f(x_i;\\alpha ) = 5 \\alpha \\ln 500 + 5 \\ln \\alpha -(\\alpha+1) \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln x_i. \\] Figure 3.4 shows the logarithmic likelihood as a function of the parameter \\(\\alpha\\). Figure 3.4: Logarithmic Likelihood for a One Parameter Pareto We can determine the maximum value of the logarithmic likelihood by taking derivatives and setting it equal to zero. This yields \\[ \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\alpha } l(\\alpha |\\mathbf{x}) = 5 \\ln 500 + 5 / \\alpha - \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln x_i =_{set} 0 \\Rightarrow \\hat{\\alpha}_{MLE} = \\frac{5}{\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln x_i - 5 \\ln 500 } = 2.453 . \\] Naturally, there are many problems where it is not practical to use hand calculations for optimization. Fortunately there are many statistical routines available such as the R function optim.

We present a few additional examples to illustrate how actuaries fit a parametric distribution model to a set of claim data using maximum likelihood. Example 3.5.2. Actuarial Exam Question. Consider a random sample of claim amounts: 8,000 10,000 12,000 15,000. You assume that claim amounts follow an inverse exponential distribution, with parameter \\(\\theta\\).

The probability density function is \\[f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\theta e^{- \\frac{\\theta}{x}}}{x^{2}}, \\] where \\(x &gt; 0\\). The likelihood function, \\(L\\left( \\theta \\right)\\), can be viewed as the probability of the observed data, written as a function of the model’s parameter \\(\\theta\\) \\[L\\left( \\theta \\right) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{4}{f_{X_{i}}\\left( x_{i} \\right)} = \\frac{\\theta^{4}e^{- \\theta\\sum_{i = 1}^{4}\\frac{1}{x_{i}}}}{\\prod_{i = 1}^{4}x_{i}^{2}}.\\] The log-likelihood function, \\(\\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right)\\), is the sum of the individual logarithms. \\[\\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right) = 4 \\ln \\theta - \\theta\\sum_{i = 1}^{4}\\frac{1}{x_{i}} - 2\\sum_{i = 1}^{4}\\ln x_{i} .\\] \\[ \\frac{d \\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right)}{d \\theta} = \\frac{4}{\\theta} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{4}\\frac{1}{x_{i}}. \\] The maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\theta\\), denoted by \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), is the solution to the equation \\[\\frac{4}{\\hat{\\theta}} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{4}{\\frac{1}{x_{i}} = 0}.\\] Thus, \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{4}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{4}\\frac{1}{x_{i}}} = 10,667\\) The second derivative of \\(\\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right)\\) is given by \\[\\frac{d^{2}\\ln L\\left( \\theta \\right)}{d\\theta^{2}} = \\frac{- 4}{\\theta^{2}}.\\] Evaluating the second derivative of the loglikelihood function at \\(\\hat{\\theta} = 10,667\\) gives a negative value, indicating \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) as the value that maximizes the loglikelihood function.

Two follow-up questions rely on large sample properties that you may have seen in an earlier course. Appendix Chapter 17 reviews the definition of the likelihood function, introduces its properties, reviews the maximum likelihood estimators, extends their large-sample properties to the case where there are multiple parameters in the model, and reviews statistical inference based on maximum likelihood estimators. In the solutions of these examples we derive the asymptotic variance of maximum-likelihood estimators of the model parameters. We use the delta method to derive the asymptotic variances of functions of these parameters. Example 3.5.2 - Follow - Up. Refer to Example 3.5.2. Approximate the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator. Determine an approximate 95% confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\). Determine an approximate 95% confidence interval for \\(\\Pr \\left( X \\leq 9,000 \\right).\\) Show Example Solution Solution. a. Taking reciprocal of negative expectation of the second derivative of \\(\\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right)\\), we obtain an estimate of the variance of \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), \\(\\widehat{Var}\\left( \\hat{\\theta} \\right) = \\left. \\ \\left\\lbrack E\\left( \\frac{d^{2}\\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right)}{d\\theta^{2}} \\right) \\right\\rbrack^{- 1} \\right|_{\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}} = \\frac{{\\hat{\\theta}}^{2}}{4} = 28,446,222\\). It should be noted that as the sample size \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) converges to a normal distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(\\hat{V}\\left( \\hat{\\theta} \\right)\\). The approximate confidence interval in this example is based on the assumption of normality, despite the small sample size, only for the purpose of illustration. b.

Estimate the covariance matrixMatrix where the (i,j)^th element represents the covariance between the ith and jth random variables of the maximum likelihood estimator. Determine approximate 95% confidence intervals for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Determine an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean of the lognormal distribution. Show Example Solution a. To derive the covariance matrix of the mleMaximum likelihood estimate we need to find the expectations of the second derivatives. Since the random variable \\(X\\) is from a lognormal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), then \\(\\text{lnX}\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\). \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\text{lnL}\\left( \\mu,\\sigma \\right)}{\\partial\\mu^{2}} \\right) = \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\frac{- 6}{\\sigma^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{- 6}{\\sigma^{2}}\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\text{lnL}\\left( \\mu,\\sigma \\right)}{\\partial\\mu\\partial\\sigma} \\right) = \\frac{- 2}{\\sigma^{3}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{6}{\\mathrm{E}\\left( \\ln x_{i} - \\mu \\right)} = \\frac{- 2}{\\sigma^{3}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{6}\\left\\lbrack \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\ln x_{i} \\right) - \\mu \\right\\rbrack\\)=\\(\\frac{- 2}{\\sigma^{3}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{6}\\left( \\mu - \\mu \\right) = 0\\), and \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\text{lnL}\\left( \\mu,\\sigma \\right)}{\\partial\\sigma^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{6}{\\sigma^{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sigma^{4}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{6}{\\mathrm{E}\\left( \\ln x_{i} - \\mu \\right)}^{2} = \\frac{6}{\\sigma^{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sigma^{4}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{6}{\\mathrm{V}\\left( \\ln x_{i} \\right) = \\frac{6}{\\sigma^{2}} - \\frac{3}{\\sigma^{4}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{6}{\\sigma^{2} = \\frac{- 12}{\\sigma^{2}}}}\\).

Since the mean of the lognormal distribution cannot be negative, we should replace the negative lower limit in the previous interval by a zero. Example 3.5.4. Wisconsin Property Fund. To see how maximum likelihood estimators work with real data, we return to the 2010 claims data introduced in Section 1.3. The following snippet of code shows how to fit the exponential, gamma, Pareto, lognormal, and GB2 models. For consistency, the code employs the R package VGAM. The acronym stands for Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models; as suggested by the name, this package can do far more than fit these models although it suffices for our purposes. The one exception is the GB2 density which is not widely used outside of insurance applications; however, we can code this density and compute maximum likelihood estimators using the optim general purpose optimizer.

Here, the black “longdash” curve is a smoothed histogram of the actual data (that we will introduce in Section 4.1); the other curves are parametric curves where the parameters are computed via maximum likelihood. We see poor fits in the red dashed line from the exponential distribution fit and the blue dotted line from the gamma distribution fit. Fits of the other curves, Pareto, lognormal, and GB2, all seem to provide reasonably good fits to the actual data. Chapter 4 describes in more detail the principles of model selection. 3.5.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimators using Modified Data In many applications, actuaries and other analysts wish to estimate model parameters based on individual data that are not limited. However, there are also important applications when only limited, or modified, data are available. This section introduces maximum likelihood estimation for grouped, censored, and truncated data. Later, we will follow up with additional details in Section 4.3. 3.5.2.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimators for Grouped Data In the previous section we considered the maximum likelihood estimation of continuous models from complete (individual) data. Each individual observation is recorded, and its contribution to the likelihood function is the density at that value. In this section we consider the problem of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of parameters from grouped dataData bucketed into categories with ranges, such as for use in histograms or frequency tables. The observations are only available in grouped form, and the contribution of each observation to the likelihood function is the probability of falling in a specific group (interval). Let \\(n_{j}\\) represent the number of observations in the interval \\(\\left( \\left. \\ c_{j - 1},c_{j} \\right\\rbrack \\right.\\ \\) The grouped data likelihood function is thus given by \\[ L\\left( \\theta \\right) = \\prod_{j = 1}^{k}\\left\\lbrack F_X\\left( \\left. \\ c_{j} \\right|\\theta \\right) - F_X\\left( \\left. \\ c_{j - 1} \\right|\\theta \\right) \\right\\rbrack^{n_{j}}, \\] where \\(c_{0}\\) is the smallest possible observation (often set to zero) and \\(c_{k}\\) is the largest possible observation (often set to infinity). Example 3.5.5. Actuarial Exam Question. For a group of policies, you are given that losses follow the distribution function \\(F_X\\left( x \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\theta}{x}\\), for \\(\\theta &lt; x &lt; \\infty.\\) Further, a sample of 20 losses resulted in the following: \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix}\\hline \\text{Interval} &amp; \\text{Number of Losses} \\\\ \\hline (\\theta, 10] &amp; 9 \\\\ (10, 25] &amp; 6 \\\\ (25, \\infty) &amp; 5 \\\\ \\hline \\end{matrix} } \\] Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The contribution of each of the 9 observations in the first interval to the likelihood function is the probability of \\(X \\leq 10\\); that is, \\(\\Pr\\left( X \\leq 10 \\right) = F_X\\left( 10 \\right)\\). Similarly, the contributions of each of 6 and 5 observations in the second and third intervals are \\(\\Pr\\left( 10 &lt; X \\leq 25 \\right) = F_X\\left( 25 \\right) - F_X(10)\\) and \\(P\\left( X &gt; 25 \\right) = 1 - F_X(25)\\), respectively. The likelihood function is thus given by \\[ L\\left( \\theta \\right) = \\left\\lbrack F_X\\left( 10 \\right) \\right\\rbrack^{9}\\left\\lbrack F_X\\left( 25 \\right) - F_X(10) \\right\\rbrack^{6}\\left\\lbrack 1 - F_X(25) \\right\\rbrack^{5} \\] \\[ = {\\left( 1 - \\frac{\\theta}{10} \\right)}^{9}\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{10} - \\frac{\\theta}{25} \\right)^{6}\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{25} \\right)^{5} \\] \\[ = {\\left( \\frac{10 - \\theta}{10} \\right)}^{9}\\left( \\frac{15\\theta}{250} \\right)^{6}\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{25} \\right)^{5}. \\] Then, \\(\\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right) = 9\\ln \\left( 10 - \\theta \\right) + 6\\ln \\theta + 5\\ln \\theta - 9\\ln 10 + 6\\ln 15 - 6\\ln 250 - 5\\ln 25\\). \\[ \\frac{d \\ln L \\left( \\theta \\right)}{d \\theta} = \\frac{- 9}{\\left( 10 - \\theta \\right)} + \\frac{6}{\\theta} + \\frac{5}{\\theta}. \\] The maximum likelihood estimator, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), is the solution to the equation \\[ \\frac{- 9}{\\left( 10 - \\hat{\\theta} \\right)} + \\frac{11}{\\hat{\\theta}} = 0 \\] and \\(\\hat{\\theta} = 5.5\\). 3.5.2.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimators for Censored Data Another possible distinguishing feature of a data gathering mechanism is censoring. While for some events of interest (losses, claims, lifetimes, etc.) the complete dataData where each individual observation is known, and no values are censored, truncated, or grouped maybe available, for others only partial information is available; all that may be known is that the observation exceeds a specific value. The limited policy introduced in Section 3.4.2 is an example of right censoring. Any loss greater than or equal to the policy limit is recorded at the limit. The contribution of the censored observation to the likelihood function is the probability of the random variable exceeding this specific limit. Note that contributions of both complete and censored data share the survivor function, for a complete point this survivor function is multiplied by the hazard function, but for a censored observation it is not. The likelihood function for censored data is then given by \\[ L(\\theta) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=1}^r f_X(x_i) \\right] \\left[ S_X(u) \\right]^m , \\] where \\(r\\) is the number of known loss amounts below the limit \\(u\\) and \\(m\\) is the number of loss amounts larger than the limit \\(u\\). Example 3.5.6. Actuarial Exam Question. The random variable \\(X\\) has survival function: \\[ S_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\theta^{4}}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + x^{2} \\right)^{2}}. \\] Two values of \\(X\\) are observed to be 2 and 4. One other value exceeds 4. Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The contributions of the two observations 2 and 4 are \\(f_{X}\\left( 2 \\right)\\) and \\(f_{X}\\left( 4 \\right)\\) respectively. The contribution of the third observation, which is only known to exceed 4 is \\(S_{X}\\left( 4 \\right)\\). The likelihood function is thus given by \\[ L\\left( \\theta \\right) = f_{X}\\left( 2 \\right)f_{X}\\left( 4 \\right)S_{X}\\left( 4 \\right). \\] The probability density function of \\(X\\) is given by \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{4x\\theta^{4}}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + x^{2} \\right)^{3}}. \\] Thus, \\[ L\\left( \\theta \\right) = \\frac{8\\theta^{4}}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + 4 \\right)^{3}}\\frac{16\\theta^{4}}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + 16 \\right)^{3}}\\frac{\\theta^{4}}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + 16 \\right)^{2}} \\\\ = \\frac{128\\theta^{12}}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + 4 \\right)^{3}\\left( \\theta^{2} + 16 \\right)^{5}}, \\] So, \\[ \\ln L\\left( \\theta \\right) = \\ln 128 + 12\\ln \\theta - 3\\ln \\left( \\theta^{2} + 4 \\right) - 5\\ln \\left( \\theta^{2} + 16 \\right) , \\] and \\(\\frac{d \\ln L\\left( \\theta \\right)}{d \\theta} = \\frac{12}{\\theta} - \\frac{6\\theta}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + 4 \\right)} - \\frac{10\\theta}{\\left( \\theta^{2} + 16 \\right)}\\). The maximum likelihood estimator, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), is the solution to the equation \\[ \\frac{12}{\\hat{\\theta}} - \\frac{6\\hat{\\theta}}{\\left( {\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} + 4 \\right)} - \\frac{10\\hat{\\theta}}{\\left( {\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} + 16 \\right)} = 0 \\] or \\[12\\left( {\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} + 4 \\right)\\left( {\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} + 16 \\right) - 6{\\hat{\\theta}}^{2}\\left( {\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} + 16 \\right) - 10{\\hat{\\theta}}^{2}\\left( {\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} + 4 \\right) = \\\\ - 4{\\hat{\\theta}}^{4} + 104{\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} + 768 = 0,\\] which yields \\({\\hat{\\theta}}^{2} = 32\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta} = 5.7\\). 3.5.2.3 Maximum Likelihood Estimators for Truncated Data This section is concerned with the maximum likelihood estimation of the continuous distribution of the random variable \\(X\\) when the data is incomplete due to truncation. If the values of \\(X\\) are truncated at \\(d\\), then it should be noted that we would not have been aware of the existence of these values had they not exceeded \\(d\\). The policy deductible introduced in Section 3.4.1 is an example of left truncation. Any loss less than or equal to the deductible is not recorded. The contribution to the likelihood function of an observation \\(x\\) truncated at \\(d\\) will be a conditional probability and the \\(f_{X}\\left( x \\right)\\) will be replaced by \\(\\frac{f_{X}\\left( x \\right)}{S_{X}\\left( d \\right)}\\). The likelihood function for truncated data is then given by \\[ L(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\frac{f_X(x_i)}{S_X(d)} , \\] where \\(k\\) is the number of loss amounts larger than the deductible \\(d\\). Example 3.5.7. Actuarial Exam Question. For the single parameter Pareto distribution with \\(\\theta = 2\\), maximum likelihood estimation is applied to estimate the parameter \\(\\alpha\\). Find the estimated mean of the ground up loss distribution based on the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\alpha\\) for the following data set: Ordinary policy deductible of 5, maximum covered loss of 25 (policy limit 20) 8 insurance payment amounts: 2, 4, 5, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15 2 limit payments: 20, 20. Show Example Solution Solution. The contributions of the different observations can be summarized as follows: For the exact loss: \\(f_{X}\\left( x \\right)\\) For censored observations: \\(S_{X}\\left( 25 \\right)\\). For truncated observations: \\(\\frac{f_{X}\\left( x \\right)}{S_{X}\\left( 5 \\right)}\\). Given that ground up losses smaller than 5 are omitted from the data set, the contribution of all observations should be conditional on exceeding 5. The likelihood function becomes \\[ L\\left( \\alpha \\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{i = 1}^{8}{f_{X}\\left( x_{i} \\right)}}{\\left\\lbrack S_{X}\\left( 5 \\right) \\right\\rbrack^{8}}\\left\\lbrack \\frac{S_{X}\\left( 25 \\right)}{S_{X}\\left( 5 \\right)} \\right\\rbrack^{2}. \\] For the single parameter Pareto the probability density and distribution functions are given by \\[ f_{X}\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha\\theta^{\\alpha}}{x^{\\alpha + 1}} \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ F_{X}\\left( x \\right) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{x} \\right)^{\\alpha}, \\] for \\(x &gt; \\theta\\), respectively. Then, the likelihood and loglikelihood functions are given by \\[ L\\left( \\alpha \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha^{8}}{\\prod_{i = 1}^{8}x_{i}^{\\alpha + 1}}\\frac{5^{10\\alpha}}{25^{2\\alpha}}, \\] \\[ \\ln L \\left( \\alpha \\right) = 8\\ln\\alpha - \\left( \\alpha + 1 \\right)\\sum_{i = 1}^{8}{\\ln x_{i}} + 10\\alpha \\ln 5 - 2\\alpha \\ln 25. \\] \\(\\frac{d \\ln L \\left( \\alpha \\right)}{d \\theta} = \\frac{8}{\\alpha} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{8}{\\ln x_{i}} + 10\\ln 5 - 2\\ln 25\\). The maximum likelihood estimator, \\(\\hat{\\alpha}\\), is the solution to the equation \\[ \\frac{8}{\\hat{\\alpha}} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{8}{\\ln x_{i}} + 10\\ln 5 - 2\\ln 25 = 0, \\] which yields \\[ \\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{8}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{8}{\\ln x_{i}} - 10\\ln 5 + 2\\ln 25} = \\frac{8}{(\\ln 7 + \\ln 9 + \\cdots + \\ln 20) - 10\\ln 5 + 2\\ln 25} = 0.785. \\] The mean of the Pareto only exists for \\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\). Since \\(\\hat{\\alpha} = 0.785 &lt; 1\\). Then, the mean does not exist.

Chapters 2 and 3 have described how to fit parametric models to frequency and severity data, respectively. This chapter begins with the selection of models. To compare alternative parametric models, it is helpful to summarize data without reference to a specific parametric distribution. Section 4.1 describes nonparametric estimation, how we can use it for model comparisons and how it can be used to provide starting values for parametric procedures. The process of model selection is then summarized in Section 4.2. Although our focus is on continuous data, the same process can be used for discrete data or data that come from a hybrid combination of discrete and continuous data. Model selection and estimation are fundamental aspects of statistical modeling. To provide a flavor as to how they can be adapted to alternative sampling schemes, Section 4.3 describes estimation for grouped, censored and truncated data (following the Section 3.5 introduction). To see how they can be adapted to alternative models, the chapter closes with Section 4.4 on Bayesian inference, an alternative procedure where the (typically unknown) parameters are treated as random variables. 4.1 Nonparametric Inference In this section, you learn how to: Estimate moments, quantiles, and distributions without reference to a parametric distribution Summarize the data graphically without reference to a parametric distribution Determine measures that summarize deviations of a parametric from a nonparametric fit Use nonparametric estimators to approximate parameters that can be used to start a parametric estimation procedure 4.1.1 Nonparametric Estimation In Section 2.2 for frequency and Section 3.1 for severity, we learned how to summarize a distribution by computing means, variances, quantiles/percentiles, and so on. To approximate these summary measures using a dataset, one strategy is to: assume a parametric form for a distribution, such as a negative binomial for frequency or a gamma distribution for severity, estimate the parameters of that distribution, and then use the distribution with the estimated parameters to calculate the desired summary measure. This is the parametricDistributional assumptions made on the population from which the data is drawn, with properties defined using parameters. approach. Another strategy is to estimate the desired summary measure directly from the observations without reference to a parametric model. Not surprisingly, this is known as the nonparametricNo distributional assumptions are made on the population from which the data is drawn. approach. Let us start by considering the most basic type of sampling schemeHow the data is obtained from the population and what data is observed. and assume that observations are realizations from a set of random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) that are iidIndependent and identically distributed draws from an unknown population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). An equivalent way of saying this is that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), is a random sample (with replacement) from \\(F(\\cdot)\\). To see how this works, we now describe nonparametric estimators of many important measures that summarize a distribution. 4.1.1.1 Moment Estimators We learned how to define moments in Section 2.2.2 for frequency and Section 3.1.1 for severity. In particular, the \\(k\\)-th moment, \\(\\mathrm{E~}[X^k] = \\mu^{\\prime}_k\\), summarizes many aspects of the distribution for different choices of k. Here, \\(\\mu^{\\prime}_k\\) is sometimes called the kth population moment to distinguish it from the kth sample moment, \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^k , \\] which is the corresponding nonparametric estimator. In typical applications, \\(k\\) is a positive integer, although it need not be. An important special case is the first moment where k=1. In this case, the prime symbol (\\(\\prime\\)) and the \\(1\\) subscript are usually dropped and one uses \\(\\mu=\\mu^{\\prime}_1\\) to denote the population mean, or simply the mean. The corresponding sample estimator for \\(\\mu\\) is called the sample mean, denoted with a bar on top of the random variable: \\[ \\bar{X} =\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i . \\] Another type of summary measure of interest is the the \\(k\\)-th central moment, \\(\\mathrm{E~} [(X-\\mu)^k] = \\mu_k\\). (Sometimes, \\(\\mu^{\\prime}_k\\) is called the \\(k\\)-th raw moment to distinguish it from the central moment \\(\\mu_k\\).). A nonparametric, or sample, estimator of \\(\\mu_k\\) is \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(X_i - \\bar{X}\\right)^k . \\] The second central moment (\\(k=2\\)) is an important case for which we typically assign a new symbol, \\(\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{E~} [(X-\\mu)^2]\\), known as the variance. Properties of sample moment estimator of the variance such as \\(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(X_i - \\bar{X}\\right)^2\\) have been studied extensively and so it is natural that many variations have been proposed. The most widely used variation is one where the effective sample size is reduced by one, and so we define \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(X_i - \\bar{X}\\right)^2. \\] Here, the statistic \\(s^2\\) known as the sample variance. Dividing by n-1 instead of n matters little when you have a sample size n in the thousands as is common in insurance applications. Still, the resulting estimator is unbiasedAn estimator that has no bias, that is, the expected value of an estimator equals the parameter being estimated. in the sense that \\(\\mathrm{E~} s^2 = \\sigma^2\\), a desirable property particularly when interpreting results of an analysis. 4.1.1.2 Empirical Distribution Function We have seen how to compute nonparametric estimators of the kth moment \\(\\mathrm{E~} X^k\\). In the same way, for any known function \\(\\mathrm{g}(\\cdot)\\), we can estimate \\(\\mathrm{E~} \\mathrm{g}(X)\\) using \\(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{g}(X_i)\\). Now suppose that we fix a value of x and consider the function \\(\\mathrm{g}(X) = I(X \\le x)\\). Here, the notation \\(I(\\cdot)\\) is the indicatorA categorical variable that has only two groups. the numerical values are usually taken to be one to indicate the presence of an attribute, and zero otherwise. another name for a binary variable. function; it returns 1 if the event \\((\\cdot)\\) is true and 0 otherwise. For this choice of \\(\\mathrm{g}(\\cdot)\\), the expected value is \\(\\mathrm{E~} I(X \\le x) = \\Pr(X \\le x) = F(x)\\), the distribution function evaluated at a fixed point x. Using the analog principle, we define the nonparametric estimator of the distribution function \\[ \\begin{aligned} F_n(x) &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n I\\left(X_i \\le x\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\text{number of observations less than or equal to }x}{n} . \\end{aligned} \\] As a nonparametric estimator, \\(F_n(\\cdot)\\) is based on only observations and does not assume a parametric family for the distribution, it is also known as the empirical distribution functionThe empirical distribution is a non-parametric estimate of the underlying distribution of a random variable. it directly uses the data observations to construct the distribution, with each observed data point in a size-n sample having probability 1/n. . Example 4.1.1. Toy Data Set. To illustrate, consider a fictitious, or “toy,” data set of \\(n=10\\) observations. Determine the empirical distribution function. \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc} \\hline i &amp;1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9&amp;10 \\\\ X_i&amp; 10 &amp;15 &amp;15 &amp;15 &amp;20 &amp;23 &amp;23 &amp;23 &amp;23 &amp;30\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Show Example Solution You should check that the sample mean is \\(\\bar{X} = 19.7\\) and that the sample variance is \\(s^2 =34.45556\\). The corresponding empirical distribution function is \\[ \\begin{aligned} F_n(x) &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 &amp; \\text{ for }\\ x&lt;10 \\\\ 0.1 &amp; \\text{ for }\\ 10 \\leq x&lt;15 \\\\ 0.4 &amp; \\text{ for }\\ 15 \\leq x&lt;20 \\\\ 0.5 &amp; \\text{ for }\\ 20 \\leq x&lt;23 \\\\ 0.9 &amp; \\text{ for }\\ 23 \\leq x&lt;30 \\\\ 1 &amp; \\text{ for }\\ x \\geq 30, \\end{array} \\right.\\end{aligned} \\] which is shown in the following graph in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1: Empirical Distribution Function of a Toy Example Show R Code (xExample &lt;- c(10,rep(15,3),20,rep(23,4),30)) PercentilesxExample &lt;- ecdf(xExample) plot(PercentilesxExample, main=&quot;&quot;,xlab=&quot;x&quot;) 4.1.1.3 Quartiles, Percentiles and Quantiles We have already seen the median50th percentile of a definition, or middle value where half of the distribution lies below, which is the number such that approximately half of a data set is below (or above) it. The first quartileThe 25th percentile; the number such that approximately 25% of the data is below it. is the number such that approximately 25% of the data is below it and the third quartileThe 75th percentile; the number such that approximately 75% of the data is below it. is the number such that approximately 75% of the data is below it. A \\(100p\\) percentileA 100p-th percentile is the number such that 100 times p percent of the data is below it. is the number such that \\(100 \\times p\\) percent of the data is below it. To generalize this concept, consider a distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\), which may or may not be continuous, and let \\(q\\) be a fraction so that \\(0&lt;q&lt;1\\). We want to define a quantileThe q-th quantile is the point(s) at which the distribution function is equal to q, i.e. the inverse of the cumulative distribution function., say \\(q_F\\), to be a number such that \\(F(q_F) \\approx q\\). Notice that when \\(q = 0.5\\), \\(q_F\\) is the median; when \\(q = 0.25\\), \\(q_F\\) is the first quartile, and so on. So, a quantile generalizes the concepts of median, quartiles, and percentiles. To be precise, for a given \\(0&lt;q&lt;1\\), define the \\(q\\)th quantile \\(q_F\\) to be any number that satisfies \\[\\begin{equation} F(q_F-) \\le q \\le F(q_F) \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] Here, the notation \\(F(x-)\\) means to evaluate the function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) as a left-hand limit. To get a better understanding of this definition, let us look at a few special cases. First, consider the case where \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable so that the distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) has no jump points, as illustrated in Figure 4.2. In this figure, a few fractions, \\(q_1\\), \\(q_2\\), and \\(q_3\\) are shown with their corresponding quantiles \\(q_{F,1}\\), \\(q_{F,2}\\), and \\(q_{F,3}\\). In each case, it can be seen that \\(F(q_F-)= F(q_F)\\) so that there is a unique quantile. Because we can find a unique inverse of the distribution function at any \\(0&lt;q&lt;1\\), we can write \\(q_F= F^{-1}(q)\\). Figure 4.2: Continuous Quantile Case Figure 4.3 shows three cases for distribution functions. The left panel corresponds to the continuous case just discussed. The middle panel displays a jump point similar to those we already saw in the empirical distribution function of Figure 4.1. For the value of \\(q\\) shown in this panel, we still have a unique value of the quantile \\(q_F\\). Even though there are many values of \\(q\\) such that \\(F(q_F-) \\le q \\le F(q_F)\\), for a particular value of \\(q\\), there is only one solution to equation (4.1). The right panel depicts a situation in which the quantile cannot be uniquely determined for the \\(q\\) shown as there is a range of \\(q_F\\)’s satisfying equation (4.1). Figure 4.3: Three Quantile Cases Example 4.1.2. Toy Data Set: Continued. Determine quantiles corresponding to the 20th, 50th, and 95th percentiles. Show Example Solution Solution. Consider Figure 4.1. The case of \\(q=0.20\\) corresponds to the middle panel, so the 20th percentile is 15. The case of \\(q=0.50\\) corresponds to the right panel, so the median is any number between 20 and 23 inclusive. Many software packages use the average 21.5 (e.g. R, as seen below). For the 95th percentile, the solution is 30. We can see from the graph that 30 also corresponds to the 99th and the 99.99th percentiles. quantile(xExample, probs=c(0.2, 0.5, 0.95), type=6) ## 20% 50% 95% ## 15.0 21.5 30.0 By taking a weighted average between data observations, smoothed empirical quantiles can handle cases such as the right panel in Figure 4.3. The \\(q\\)th smoothed empirical quantileA quantile obtained by linear interpolation between two empirical quantiles, i.e. data points. is defined as \\[ \\hat{\\pi}_q = (1-h) X_{(j)} + h X_{(j+1)} \\] where \\(j=\\lfloor(n+1)q\\rfloor\\), \\(h=(n+1)q-j\\), and \\(X_{(1)}, \\ldots, X_{(n)}\\) are the ordered values (known as the order statistics) corresponding to \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). Note that \\(\\hat{\\pi}_q\\) is simply a linear interpolation between \\(X_{(j)}\\) and \\(X_{(j+1)}\\). Example 4.1.3. Toy Data Set: Continued. Determine the 50th and 20th smoothed percentiles. Show Example Solution Solution Take \\(n=10\\) and \\(q=0.5\\). Then, \\(j=\\lfloor(11)0.5 \\rfloor= \\lfloor5.5 \\rfloor=5\\) and \\(h=(11)(0.5)-5=0.5\\). Then the 0.5-th smoothed empirical quantile is \\[\\hat{\\pi}_{0.5} = (1-0.5) X_{(5)} + (0.5) X_{(6)} = 0.5 (20) + (0.5)(23) = 21.5.\\] Now take \\(n=10\\) and \\(q=0.2\\). In this case, \\(j=\\lfloor(11)0.2\\rfloor=\\lfloor 2.2 \\rfloor=2\\) and \\(h=(11)(0.2)-2=0.2\\). Then the 0.2-th smoothed empirical quantile is \\[\\hat{\\pi}_{0.2} = (1-0.2) X_{(2)} + (0.2) X_{(3)} = 0.2 (15) + (0.8)(15) = 15.\\] 4.1.1.4 Density Estimators Discrete Variable. When the random variable is discrete, estimating the probability mass function \\(f(x) = \\Pr(X=x)\\) is straightforward. We simply use the sample average, defined to be \\[f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i = x).\\] Continuous Variable within a Group. For a continuous random variable, consider a discretized formulation in which the domain of \\(F(\\cdot)\\) is partitioned by constants \\(\\{c_0 &lt; c_1 &lt; \\cdots &lt; c_k\\}\\) into intervals of the form \\([c_{j-1}, c_j)\\), for \\(j=1, \\ldots, k\\). The data observations are thus “grouped” by the intervals into which they fall. Then, we might use the basic definition of the empirical mass function, or a variation such as \\[f_n(x) = \\frac{n_j}{n \\times (c_j - c_{j-1})} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ c_{j-1} \\le x &lt; c_j,\\] where \\(n_j\\) is the number of observations (\\(X_i\\)) that fall into the interval \\([c_{j-1}, c_j)\\). Continuous Variable (not grouped). Extending this notion to instances where we observe individual data, note that we can always create arbitrary groupings and use this formula. More formally, let \\(b&gt;0\\) be a small positive constant, known as a bandwidthA small positive constant that defines the width of the steps and the degree of smoothing., and define a density estimator to be \\[\\begin{equation} f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{2nb} \\sum_{i=1}^n I(x-b &lt; X_i \\le x + b) \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Show A Snippet of Theory The idea is that the estimator \\(f_n(x)\\) in equation (4.2) is the average over \\(n\\) iid realizations of a random variable with mean \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E~ } \\frac{1}{2b} I(x-b &lt; X \\le x + b) &amp;= \\frac{1}{2b}\\left(F(x+b)-F(x-b)\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{2b} \\left( \\left\\{ F(x) + b F^{\\prime}(x) + b^2 C_1\\right\\} \\left\\{ F(x) - b F^{\\prime}(x) + b^2 C_2\\right\\} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= F^{\\prime}(x) + b \\frac{C_1-C_2}{2} \\rightarrow F^{\\prime}(x) = f(x), \\end{aligned} \\] as \\(b\\rightarrow 0\\). That is, \\(f_n(x)\\) is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of \\(f(x)\\) (its expectation approaches the true value as sample size increases to infinity). This development assumes some smoothness of \\(F(\\cdot)\\), in particular, twice differentiability at \\(x\\), but makes no assumptions on the form of the distribution function \\(F\\). Because of this, the density estimator \\(f_n\\) is said to be nonparametric. More generally, define the kernel density estimatorA nonparametric estimator of the density function of a random variable. of the pdfProbability density function at x as \\[\\begin{equation} f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{nb} \\sum_{i=1}^n w\\left(\\frac{x-X_i}{b}\\right) , \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(w\\) is a probability density function centered about 0. Note that equation (4.2) simply becomes the kernel density estimator where \\(w(x) = \\frac{1}{2}I(-1 &lt; x \\le 1)\\), also known as the uniform kernel. Other popular choices are shown in Table 4.1. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 4.1: Popular Choices for the Kernel Density Estimator}\\\\ \\begin{array}{l|cc} \\hline \\text{Kernel} &amp; w(x) \\\\ \\hline \\text{Uniform } &amp; \\frac{1}{2}I(-1 &lt; x \\le 1) \\\\ \\text{Triangle} &amp; (1-|x|)\\times I(|x| \\le 1) \\\\ \\text{Epanechnikov} &amp; \\frac{3}{4}(1-x^2) \\times I(|x| \\le 1) \\\\ \\text{Gaussian} &amp; \\phi(x) \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\end{matrix} } \\] Here, \\(\\phi(\\cdot)\\) is the standard normal density function. As we will see in the following example, the choice of bandwidth \\(b\\) comes with a bias-variance tradeoffThe tradeoff between model simplicity (underfitting; high bias) and flexibility (overfitting; high variance). between matching local distributional features and reducing the volatility. Example 4.1.4. Property Fund. Figure 4.4 shows a histogram (with shaded gray rectangles) of logarithmic property claims from 2010. The (blue) thick curve represents a Gaussian kernel density where the bandwidth was selected automatically using an ad hoc rule based on the sample size and volatility of the data. For this dataset, the bandwidth turned out to be \\(b=0.3255\\). For comparison, the (red) dashed curve represents the density estimator with a bandwidth equal to 0.1 and the green smooth curve uses a bandwidth of 1. As anticipated, the smaller bandwidth (0.1) indicates taking local averages over less data so that we get a better idea of the local average, but at the price of higher volatility. In contrast, the larger bandwidth (1) smooths out local fluctuations, yielding a smoother curve that may miss perturbations in the local average. For actuarial applications, we mainly use the kernel density estimator to get a quick visual impression of the data. From this perspective, you can simply use the default ad hoc rule for bandwidth selection, knowing that you have the ability to change it depending on the situation at hand.

The concept can also be extended to give smooth versions of an empirical distribution function. Given the definition of the kernel density estimator, the kernel estimator of the distribution function can be found as \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{F}_n(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n W\\left(\\frac{x-X_i}{b}\\right).\\end{aligned} \\] where \\(W\\) is the distribution function associated with the kernel density \\(w\\). To illustrate, for the uniform kernel, we have \\(w(y) = \\frac{1}{2}I(-1 &lt; y \\le 1)\\), so \\[ \\begin{aligned} W(y) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; y&lt;-1\\\\ \\frac{y+1}{2}&amp; -1 \\le y &lt; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; y \\ge 1 \\\\ \\end{cases}\\end{aligned} . \\] Example 4.1.5. Actuarial Exam Question. You study five lives to estimate the time from the onset of a disease to death. The times to death are: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 7 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Using a triangular kernel with bandwith \\(2\\), calculate the density function estimate at 2.5. Show Example Solution Solution. For the kernel density estimate, we have \\[f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{nb} \\sum_{i=1}^n w\\left(\\frac{x-X_i}{b}\\right),\\] where \\(n=5\\), \\(b=2\\), and \\(x=2.5\\). For the triangular kernel, \\(w(x) = (1-|x|)\\times I(|x| \\le 1)\\). Thus, \\[ \\begin{array}{c|c|c} \\hline X_i &amp; \\frac{x-X_i}{b} &amp; w\\left(\\frac{x-X_i}{b} \\right) \\\\ \\hline 2 &amp; \\frac{2.5-2}{2}=\\frac{1}{4} &amp; (1-\\frac{1}{4})(1) = \\frac{3}{4} \\\\ \\hline 3 &amp; &amp; \\\\ 3 &amp; \\frac{2.5-3}{2}=\\frac{-1}{4} &amp; \\left(1-\\left| \\frac{-1}{4} \\right| \\right)(1) = \\frac{3}{4} \\\\ 3 &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\hline 7 &amp; \\frac{2.5-7}{2}=-2.25 &amp; (1-|-2.25|)(0) = 0\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Then the kernel density estimate is \\[f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{5(2)}\\left( \\frac{3}{4} + (3) \\frac{3}{4} + 0 \\right) = \\frac{3}{10}\\] 4.1.1.5 Plug-in Principle One way to create a nonparametric estimator is to use the analog or plug-in principleThe plug-in principle or analog principle of estimation proposes that population parameters be estimated by sample statistics which have the same property in the sample as the parameters do in the population. where one replaces the unknown cdfCumulative distribution function \\(F\\) with a known estimate such as the empirical cdf \\(F_n\\). So, if we are trying to estimate \\(\\mathrm{E}~\\mathrm{g}(X)=\\mathrm{E}_F~\\mathrm{g}(X)\\) for a generic function g, then we define a nonparametric estimator to be \\(\\mathrm{E}_{F_n}~\\mathrm{g}(X)=n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{g}(X_i)\\). To see how this works, as a special case of g we consider the loss elimination ratio introduced in Section 3.4.1, \\[ LER(d) = \\frac{\\mathrm{E~}(\\min(X,d) )}{\\mathrm{E~}(X)} \\] for a fixed deductible \\(d\\). Example. 4.1.11. Bodily Injury Claims and Loss Elimination Ratios We use a sample of 432 closed auto claims from Boston from Derrig, Ostaszewski, and Rempala (2001). Losses are recorded for payments due to bodily injuries in auto accidents. Losses are not subject to deductibles but are subject to various policy limits also available in the data. It turns out that only 17 out of 432 (\\(\\approx\\) 4%) were subject to policy limit and so we ignore these data for this illustration. The average loss paid is 6906. Figure 4.5 shows other aspects of the distribution. Specifically, the left-hand panel shows the empirical distribution function, the right-hand panel gives a nonparametric density plot. Figure 4.5: Bodily Injury Claims. The left-hand panel gives the empirical distribution function. The right-hand panel presents a nonparametric density plot. The impact of bodily injury losses can be mitigated by the imposition of limits or purchasing reinsurance policies (see Section 10.3). To quantify the impact of these risk mitigation tools, it is common to compute the loss elimination ratio (LER) as introduced in Section 3.4.1. The distribution function is not available and so much be estimated in some way. Using the plug-in principle, a nonparametric estimator can be defined as \\[ LER_n(d) = \\frac{n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\min(X_i,d)}{n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\min(X_i,d)}{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i} . \\] Figure 4.5 shows the estimator \\(LER_n(d)\\) for various choices of d. For example, if \\(d=14,000\\), then it turns out that \\(LER_n(14000) \\approx\\) 0.9768. Imposing a limit of 14,000 means that we expect to retain 97.68 percent of claims. Figure 4.6: LER for Bodily Injury Claims. The figure presents the loss elimination ratio (LER) as a function of deductible d. 4.1.2 Tools for Model Selection and Diagnostics The previous section introduced nonparametric estimators in which there was no parametric form assumed about the underlying distributions. However, in many actuarial applications, analysts seek to employ a parametric fit of a distribution for ease of explanation and the ability to readily extend it to more complex situations such as including explanatory variables in a regression setting. When fitting a parametric distribution, one analyst might try to use a gamma distribution to represent a set of loss data. However, another analyst may prefer to use a Pareto distribution. How does one know which model to select? Nonparametric tools can be used to corroborate the selection of parametric models. Essentially, the approach is to compute selected summary measures under a fitted parametric model and to compare it to the corresponding quantity under the nonparametric model. As the nonparametric does not assume a specific distribution and is merely a function of the data, it is used as a benchmark to assess how well the parametric distribution/model represents the data. This comparison may alert the analyst to deficiencies in the parametric model and sometimes point ways to improving the parametric specification. Procedures geared towards assessing the validity of a model are known as model diagnosticsProcedures to assess the validity of a model. 4.1.2.1 Graphical Comparison of Distributions We have already seen the technique of overlaying graphs for comparison purposes. To reinforce the application of this technique, Figure 4.7 compares the empirical distribution to two parametric fitted distributions. The left panel shows the distribution functions of claims distributions. The dots forming an “S-shaped” curve represent the empirical distribution function at each observation. The thick blue curve gives corresponding values for the fitted gamma distribution and the light purple is for the fitted Pareto distribution. Because the Pareto is much closer to the empirical distribution function than the gamma, this provides evidence that the Pareto is the better model for this data set. The right panel gives similar information for the density function and provides a consistent message. Based (only) on these figures, the Pareto distribution is the clear choice for the analyst. Figure 4.7: Nonparametric Versus Fitted Parametric Distribution and Density Functions. The left-hand panel compares distribution functions, with the dots corresponding to the empirical distribution, the thick blue curve corresponding to the fitted gamma and the light purple curve corresponding to the fitted Pareto. The right hand panel compares these three distributions summarized using probability density functions. For another way to compare the appropriateness of two fitted models, consider the probability-probability (pp) plotA plot that compares two models through their cumulative probabilities.. A \\(pp\\) plot compares cumulative probabilities under two models. For our purposes, these two models are the nonparametric empirical distribution function and the parametric fitted model. Figure 4.8 shows \\(pp\\) plots for the Property Fund data. The fitted gamma is on the left and the fitted Pareto is on the right, compared to the same empirical distribution function of the data. The straight line represents equality between the two distributions being compared, so points close to the line are desirable. As seen in earlier demonstrations, the Pareto is much closer to the empirical distribution than the gamma, providing additional evidence that the Pareto is the better model. Figure 4.8: Probability-Probability (\\(pp\\)) Plots. The horizontal axes gives the empirical distribution function at each observation. In the left-hand panel, the corresponding distribution function for the gamma is shown in the vertical axis. The right-hand panel shows the fitted Pareto distribution. Lines of \\(y=x\\) are superimposed. A \\(pp\\) plot is useful in part because no artificial scaling is required, such as with the overlaying of densities in Figure 4.7, in which we switched to the log scale to better visualize the data. The Chapter 4 Technical Supplement A.1 introduces a variation of the \\(pp\\) plot known as a Lorenz curveA graph of the proportion of a population on the horizontal axis and a distribution function of interest on the vertical axis.; this is an important tool for assessing income inequality. Furthermore, \\(pp\\) plots are available in multivariate settings where more than one outcome variable is available. However, a limitation of the \\(pp\\) plot is that, because it is a plot cumulative distribution functions, it can sometimes be difficult to detect where a fitted parametric distribution is deficient. As an alternative, it is common to use a quantile-quantile (qq) plotA plot that compares two models through their quantiles., as demonstrated in Figure 4.9. The \\(qq\\) plot compares two fitted models through their quantiles. As with \\(pp\\) plots, we compare the nonparametric to a parametric fitted model. Quantiles may be evaluated at each point of the data set, or on a grid (e.g., at \\(0, 0.001, 0.002, \\ldots, 0.999, 1.000\\)), depending on the application. In Figure 4.9, for each point on the aforementioned grid, the horizontal axis displays the empirical quantile and the vertical axis displays the corresponding fitted parametric quantile (gamma for the upper two panels, Pareto for the lower two). Quantiles are plotted on the original scale in the left panels and on the log scale in the right panels to allow us to see where a fitted distribution is deficient. The straight line represents equality between the empirical distribution and fitted distribution. From these plots, we again see that the Pareto is an overall better fit than the gamma. Furthermore, the lower-right panel suggests that the Pareto distribution does a good job with large observations, but provides a poorer fit for small observations. Figure 4.9: Quantile-Quantile (\\(qq\\)) Plots. The horizontal axes gives the empirical quantiles at each observation. The right-hand panels they are graphed on a logarithmic basis. The vertical axis gives the quantiles from the fitted distributions; gamma quantiles are in the upper panels, Pareto quantiles are in the lower panels. Example 4.1.6. Actuarial Exam Question. The graph below shows a \\(pp\\) plot of a fitted distribution compared to a sample. Comment on the two distributions with respect to left tail, right tail, and median probabilities. Show Example Solution Solution. The tail of the fitted distribution is too thick on the left, too thin on the right, and the fitted distribution has less probability around the median than the sample. To see this, recall that the \\(pp\\) plot graphs the cumulative distribution of two distributions on its axes (empirical on the x-axis and fitted on the y-axis in this case). For small values of \\(x\\), the fitted model assigns greater probability to being below that value than occurred in the sample (i.e. \\(F(x) &gt; F_n(x)\\)). This indicates that the model has a heavier left tail than the data. For large values of \\(x\\), the model again assigns greater probability to being below that value and thus less probability to being above that value (i.e. \\(S(x) &lt; S_n(x)\\). This indicates that the model has a lighter right tail than the data. In addition, as we go from 0.4 to 0.6 on the horizontal axis (thus looking at the middle 20% of the data), the \\(pp\\) plot increases from about 0.3 to 0.4. This indicates that the model puts only about 10% of the probability in this range. 4.1.2.2 Statistical Comparison of Distributions When selecting a model, it is helpful to make the graphical displays presented. However, for reporting results, it can be effective to supplement the graphical displays with selected statistics that summarize model goodness of fit. Table 4.2 provides three commonly used goodness of fit statisticsA measure used to assess how well a statistical model fits the data, usually by summarizing the discrepancy between the observations and the expected values under the model.. In this table, \\(F_n\\) is the empirical distribution, \\(F\\) is the fitted or hypothesized distribution, and \\(F_i = F(x_i)\\). \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 4.2: Three Goodness of Fit Statistics} \\\\ \\begin{array}{l|cc} \\hline \\text{Statistic} &amp; \\text{Definition} &amp; \\text{Computational Expression} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Kolmogorov-} &amp; \\max_x |F_n(x) - F(x)| &amp; \\max(D^+, D^-) \\text{ where } \\\\ ~~~\\text{Smirnov} &amp;&amp; D^+ = \\max_{i=1, \\ldots, n} \\left|\\frac{i}{n} - F_i\\right| \\\\ &amp;&amp; D^- = \\max_{i=1, \\ldots, n} \\left| F_i - \\frac{i-1}{n} \\right| \\\\ \\text{Cramer-von Mises} &amp; n \\int (F_n(x) - F(x))^2 f(x) dx &amp; \\frac{1}{12n} + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(F_i - (2i-1)/n\\right)^2 \\\\ \\text{Anderson-Darling} &amp; n \\int \\frac{(F_n(x) - F(x))^2}{F(x)(1-F(x))} f(x) dx &amp; -n-\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1) \\log\\left(F_i(1-F_{n+1-i})\\right)^2 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\\\ \\end{matrix} } \\] The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is the maximum absolute difference between the fitted distribution function and the empirical distribution function. Instead of comparing differences between single points, the Cramer-von Mises statistic integrates the difference between the empirical and fitted distribution functions over the entire range of values. The Anderson-Darling statistic also integrates this difference over the range of values, although weighted by the inverse of the variance. It therefore places greater emphasis on the tails of the distribution (i.e when \\(F(x)\\) or \\(1-F(x)=S(x)\\) is small). Exaxmple 4.1.7. Actuarial Exam Question (modified). A sample of claim payments is: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 29 &amp; 64 &amp; 90 &amp; 135 &amp; 182 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Compare the empirical claims distribution to an exponential distribution with mean \\(100\\) by calculating the value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. Show Example Solution Solution. For an exponential distribution with mean \\(100\\), the cumulative distribution function is \\(F(x)=1-e^{-x/100}\\). Thus, \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\hline x &amp; F(x) &amp; F_n(x) &amp; F_n(x-) &amp; \\max(|F(x)-F_n(x)|,|F(x)-F_n(x-)|) \\\\ \\hline 29 &amp; 0.2517 &amp; 0.2 &amp; 0 &amp; \\max(0.0517, 0.2517) = 0.2517 \\\\ 64 &amp; 0.4727 &amp; 0.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; \\max(0.0727, 0.2727) = 0.2727 \\\\ 90 &amp; 0.5934 &amp; 0.6 &amp; 0.4 &amp; \\max(0.0066, 0.1934) = 0.1934 \\\\ 135 &amp; 0.7408 &amp; 0.8 &amp; 0.6 &amp; \\max(0.0592, 0.1408) = 0.1408 \\\\ 182 &amp; 0.8380 &amp; 1 &amp; 0.8 &amp; \\max(0.1620, 0.0380) = 0.1620 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is therefore \\(KS = \\max(0.2517, 0.2727, 0.1934, 0.1408, 0.1620) = 0.2727\\). 4.1.3 Starting Values The method of moments and percentile matching are nonparametric estimation methods that provide alternatives to maximum likelihood. Generally, maximum likelihood is the preferred technique because it employs data more efficiently. (See Appendix Chapter 17 for precise definitions of efficiency.) However, methods of moments and percentile matching are useful because they are easier to interpret and therefore allow the actuary or analyst to explain procedures to others. Additionally, the numerical estimation procedure (e.g. if performed in R) for the maximum likelihood is iterative and requires starting values to begin the recursive process. Although many problems are robust to the choice of the starting values, for some complex situations, it can be important to have a starting value that is close to the (unknown) optimal value. Method of moments and percentile matching are techniques that can produce desirable estimates without a serious computational investment and can thus be used as a starting value for computing maximum likelihood. 4.1.3.1 Method of Moments Under the method of momentsThe estimation of population parameters by approximating parametric moments using empirical sample moments., we approximate the moments of the parametric distribution using the empirical (nonparametric) moments described in Section 4.1.1.1. We can then algebraically solve for the parameter estimates. Example 4.1.8. Property Fund. For the 2010 property fund, there are \\(n=1,377\\) individual claims (in thousands of dollars) with \\[m_1 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = 26.62259 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ m_2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 = 136154.6 .\\] Fit the parameters of the gamma and Pareto distributions using the method of moments. Show Example Solution Solution. To fit a gamma distribution, we have \\(\\mu_1 = \\alpha \\theta\\) and \\(\\mu_2^{\\prime} = \\alpha(\\alpha+1) \\theta^2\\). Equating the two yields the method of moments estimators, easy algebra shows that \\[\\alpha = \\frac{\\mu_1^2}{\\mu_2^{\\prime}-\\mu_1^2} \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\theta = \\frac{\\mu_2^{\\prime}-\\mu_1^2}{\\mu_1}.\\] Thus, the method of moment estimators are \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\alpha} &amp;= \\frac{26.62259^2}{136154.6-26.62259^2} = 0.005232809 \\\\ \\hat{\\theta} &amp;= \\frac{136154.6-26.62259^2}{26.62259} = 5,087.629. \\end{aligned} \\] For comparison, the maximum likelihood values turn out to be \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_{MLE} = 0.2905959\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE} = 91.61378\\), so there are big discrepancies between the two estimation procedures. This is one indication, as we have seen before, that the gamma model fits poorly. In contrast, now assume a Pareto distribution so that \\(\\mu_1 = \\theta/(\\alpha -1)\\) and \\(\\mu_2^{\\prime} = 2\\theta^2/((\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2) )\\). Easy algebra shows \\[\\alpha = 1+ \\frac{\\mu_2^{\\prime}}{\\mu_2^{\\prime}-\\mu_1^2} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\theta = (\\alpha-1)\\mu_1.\\] Thus, the method of moment estimators are \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\alpha} &amp;= 1+ \\frac{136154.6}{136154.6-26,62259^2} = 2.005233 \\\\ \\hat{\\theta} &amp;= (2.005233-1) \\cdot 26.62259 = 26.7619 \\end{aligned} \\] The maximum likelihood values turn out to be \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_{MLE} = 0.9990936\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE} = 2.2821147\\). It is interesting that \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_{MLE}&lt;1\\); for the Pareto distribution, recall that \\(\\alpha &lt;1\\) means that the mean is infinite. This is another indication that the property claims data set is a long tail distribution. As the above example suggests, there is flexibility with the method of moments. For example, we could have matched the second and third moments instead of the first and second, yielding different estimators. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a solution will exist for each problem. You will also find that matching moments is possible for a few problems where the data are censored or truncated, but in general, this is a more difficult scenario. Finally, for distributions where the moments do not exist or are infinite, method of moments is not available. As an alternative, one can use the percentile matching technique. 4.1.3.2 Percentile Matching Under percentile matchingThe estimation of population parameters by approximating parametric percentiles using empirical quantiles., we approximate the quantiles or percentiles of the parametric distribution using the empirical (nonparametric) quantiles or percentiles described in Section 4.1.1.3. Example 4.1.9. Property Fund. For the 2010 property fund, we illustrate matching on quantiles. In particular, the Pareto distribution is intuitively pleasing because of the closed-form solution for the quantiles. Recall that the distribution function for the Pareto distribution is \\[F(x) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{x+\\theta}\\right)^{\\alpha}.\\] Easy algebra shows that we can express the quantile as \\[F^{-1}(q) = \\theta \\left( (1-q)^{-1/\\alpha} -1 \\right).\\] for a fraction \\(q\\), \\(0&lt;q&lt;1\\). Determine estimates of the Pareto distribution parameters using the 25th and 95th empirical quantiles. Show Example Solution Solution. The 25th percentile (the first quartile) turns out to be \\(0.78853\\) and the 95th percentile is \\(50.98293\\) (both in thousands of dollars). With two equations \\[0.78853 = \\theta \\left( 1- (1-.25)^{-1/\\alpha} \\right) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ 50.98293 = \\theta \\left( 1- (1-.75)^{-1/\\alpha} \\right)\\] and two unknowns, the solution is \\[\\hat{\\alpha} = 0.9412076 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\hat{\\theta} = 2.205617 .\\] We remark here that a numerical routine is required for these solutions as no analytic solution is available. Furthermore, recall that the maximum likelihood estimates are \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_{MLE} = 0.9990936\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE} = 2.2821147\\), so the percentile matching provides a better approximation for the Pareto distribution than the method of moments. Example 4.1.10. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given: Losses follow a loglogistic distribution with cumulative distribution function: \\[F(x) = \\frac{\\left(x/\\theta\\right)^{\\gamma}}{1+\\left(x/\\theta\\right)^{\\gamma}}\\] The sample of losses is: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccccc} 10 &amp;35 &amp;80 &amp;86 &amp;90 &amp;120 &amp;158 &amp;180 &amp;200 &amp;210 &amp;1500 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Calculate the estimate of \\(\\theta\\) by percentile matching, using the 40th and 80th empirically smoothed percentile estimates. Show Example Solution Solution. With 11 observations, we have \\(j=\\lfloor(n+1)q\\rfloor = \\lfloor 12(0.4) \\rfloor = \\lfloor 4.8\\rfloor=4\\) and \\(h=(n+1)q-j = 12(0.4)-4=0.8\\). By interpolation, the 40th empirically smoothed percentile estimate is \\(\\hat{\\pi}_{0.4} = (1-h) X_{(j)} + h X_{(j+1)} = 0.2(86)+0.8(90)=89.2\\). Similarly, for the 80th empirically smoothed percentile estimate, we have \\(12(0.8)=9.6\\) so the estimate is \\(\\hat{\\pi}_{0.8} = 0.4(200)+0.6(210)=206\\). Using the loglogistic cumulative distribution, we need to solve the following two equations for parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\): \\[0.4=\\frac{(89.2/\\theta)^\\gamma}{1+(89.2/\\theta)^\\gamma} \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ 0.8=\\frac{(206/\\theta)^\\gamma}{1+(206+\\theta)^\\gamma}\\] Solving for each parenthetical expression gives \\(\\frac{2}{3}=(89.2/\\theta)^\\gamma\\) and \\(4=(206/\\theta)^\\gamma\\). Taking the ratio of the second equation to the first gives \\(6=(206/89.2)^\\gamma \\Rightarrow \\gamma=\\frac{\\ln(6)}{\\ln(206/89.2)} = 2.1407\\). Then \\(4^{1/2.1407}=206/\\theta \\Rightarrow \\theta=107.8\\) Like the method of moments, percentile matching is almost too flexible in the sense that many estimators can be based on percentile matches; for example, one actuary can base estimation on the 25th and 95th percentiles whereas another actuary uses the 20th and 80th percentiles. In general these estimators will differ and there is no compelling reason to prefer one over the other. Also as with the method of moments, percentile matching is appealing because it provides a technique that can be readily applied in selected situations and has an intuitive basis. Although most actuarial applications use maximum likelihood estimators, it can be convenient to have alternative approaches such as method of moments and percentile matching available. Show Quiz Solution 4.2 Model Selection In this section, you learn how to: Describe the iterative model selection specification process Outline steps needed to select a parametric model Describe pitfalls of model selection based purely on insample data when compared to the advantages of out-of-sample model validation This section underscores the idea that model selection is an iterative process in which models are cyclically (re)formulated and tested for appropriateness before using them for inference. After an overview, we describe the model selectionThe process of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models using data. process based on: an in-sampleA dataset used for analysis and model development. also known as a training dataset. or training dataset, an out-of-sampleA dataset used for model validation. also known as a test dataset. or test dataset, and a method that combines these approaches known as cross-validationA model validation procedure in which the data sample is partitioned into subsamples, where splits are formed by separately taking each subsample as the out-of-sample dataset.. 4.2.1 Iterative Model Selection In our development, we examine the data graphically, hypothesize a model structure, and compare the data to a candidate model in order to formulate an improved model. Box (1980) describes this as an iterative process which is shown in Figure 4.10. Figure 4.10: The iterative model specification process. This iterative process provides a useful recipe for structuring the task of specifying a model to represent a set of data. The first step, the model formulation stage, is accomplished by examining the data graphically and using prior knowledge of relationships, such as from economic theory or industry practice. The second step in the iteration is fitting based on the assumptions of the specified model. These assumptions must be consistent with the data to make valid use of the model. The third step is diagnostic checking; the data and model must be consistent with one another before additional inferences can be made. Diagnostic checking is an important part of the model formulation; it can reveal mistakes made in previous steps and provide ways to correct these mistakes. The iterative process also emphasizes the skills you need to make analytics work. First, you need a willingness to summarize information numerically and portray this information graphically. Second, it is important to develop an understanding of model properties. You should understand how a probabilistic model behaves in order to match a set of data to it. Third, theoretical properties of the model are also important for inferring general relationships based on the behavior of the data. 4.2.2 Model Selection Based on a Training Dataset It is common to refer to a dataset used for analysis as an in-sample or training dataset. Techniques available for selecting a model depend upon whether the outcomes \\(X\\) are discrete, continuous, or a hybrid of the two, although the principles are the same. Graphical and other Basic Summary Measures. Begin by summarizing the data graphically and with statistics that do not rely on a specific parametric form, as summarized in Section 4.1. Specifically, you will want to graph both the empirical distribution and density functions. Particularly for loss data that contain many zeros and that can be skewed, deciding on the appropriate scale (e.g., logarithmic) may present some difficulties. For discrete data, tables are often preferred. Determine sample moments, such as the mean and variance, as well as selected quantiles, including the minimum, maximum, and the median. For discrete data, the mode (or most frequently occurring value) is usually helpful. These summaries, as well as your familiarity of industry practice, will suggest one or more candidate parametric models. Generally, start with the simpler parametric models (for example, one parameter exponential before a two parameter gamma), gradually introducing more complexity into the modeling process. Critique the candidate parametric model numerically and graphically. For the graphs, utilize the tools introduced in Section 4.1.2 such as \\(pp\\) and \\(qq\\) plots. For the numerical assessments, examine the statistical significance of parameters and try to eliminate parameters that do not provide additional information. Likelihood Ratio Tests. For comparing model fits, if one model is a subset of another, then a likelihood ratio test may be employed; the general approach to likelihood ratio testing is described in Sections 15.4.3 and 17.3.2. Goodness of Fit Statistics. Generally, models are not proper subsets of one another so overall goodness of fit statistics are helpful for comparing models. Information criteria are one type of goodness of statistic. The most widely used examples are Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and the (Schwarz) Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC); they are widely cited because they can be readily generalized to multivariate settings. Section 15.4.4 provides a summary of these statistics. For selecting the appropriate distribution, statistics that compare a parametric fit to a nonparametric alternative, summarized in Section 4.1.2.2, are useful for model comparison. For discrete data, a goodness of fit statistic (as described in Section 2.7) is generally preferred as it is more intuitive and simpler to explain. 4.2.3 Model Selection Based on a Test Dataset Model validationThe process of confirming that the proposed model is appropriate. is the process of confirming that the proposed model is appropriate, especially in light of the purposes of the investigation. An important limitation of the model selection process based only on insample data is that it can be susceptible to data-snoopingRepeatedly fitting models to a data set without a prior hypothesis of interest., that is, fitting a great number of models to a single set of data. By looking at a large number of models, we may overfit the data and understate the natural variation in our representation. Selecting a model based only on insample data also does not support the goal of predictive inferencePreditive inference is the process of using past data observations to predict future observations.. Particularly in actuarial applications, our goal is to make statements about new experience rather than a dataset at hand. For example, we use claims experience from one year to develop a model that can be used to price insurance contracts for the following year. As an analogy, we can think about the training data set as experience from one year that is used to predict the behavior of the next year’s test data set. We can respond to these criticisms by using a technique sometimes known as out-of-sample validation. The ideal situation is to have available two sets of data, one for training, or model development, and one for testing, or model validation. We initially develop one or several models on the first data set that we call our candidate models. Then, the relative performance of the candidate models can be measured on the second set of data. In this way, the data used to validate the model is unaffected by the procedures used to formulate the model. Random Split of the Data. Unfortunately, rarely will two sets of data be available to the investigator. However, we can implement the validation process by splitting the data set into training and test subsamples, respectively. Figure 4.11 illustrates this splitting of the data. Figure 4.11: Model Validation. A data set is randomly split into two subsamples. Various researchers recommend different proportions for the allocation. Snee (1977) suggests that data-splitting not be done unless the sample size is moderately large. The guidelines of Picard and Berk (1990) show that the greater the number of parameters to be estimated, the greater the proportion of observations needed for the model development subsample. Model Validation Statistics. Much of the literature supporting the establishment of a model validation process is based on regression and classification models that you can think of as an input-output problem (James et al. (2013)). That is, we have several inputs \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_k\\) that are related to an output \\(y\\) through a function such as \\[y = \\mathrm{g}\\left(x_1, \\ldots, x_k\\right).\\] One uses the training sample to develop an estimate of \\(\\mathrm{g}\\), say, \\(\\hat{\\mathrm{g}}\\), and then calibrate the distance from the observed outcomes to the predictions using a criterion of the form \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_i \\mathrm{d}(y_i,\\hat{\\mathrm{g}}\\left(x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\right) ) . \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] Here, the sum i is over the test data. In many regression applications, it is common to use squared Euclidean distance of the form \\(\\mathrm{d}(y_i,\\mathrm{g}) = (y_i-\\mathrm{g})^2\\). In actuarial applications, Euclidean distance \\(\\mathrm{d}(y_i,\\mathrm{g}) = |y_i-\\mathrm{g}|\\) is often preferred because of the skewed nature of the data (large outlying values of \\(y\\) can have a large effect on the measure). Chapter 7 describes another measure, the Gini indexA measure for assessing income inequality. it measures the discrepancy between the income and population distributions and is calculated from the lorenz curve., that is useful in actuarial applications particularly when there is a large proportion of zeros in claims data (corresponding to no claims). Selecting a Distribution. Still, our focus so far has been to select a distribution for a data set that can be used for actuarial modeling without additional inputs \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_k\\). Even in this more fundamental problem, the model validation approach is valuable. If we base all inference on only in-sample data, then there is a tendency to select more complicated models then needed. For example, we might select a four parameter GB2, generalized beta of the second kind, distribution when only a two parameter Pareto is needed. Information criteria such as AICAkaike’s information criterion and BICBayesian information criterion included penalties for model complexity and so provide some protection but using a test sample is the best guarantee to achieve parsimonious models. From a quote often attributed to Albert Einstein, we want to “use the simplest model as possible but no simpler.” 4.2.4 Model Selection Based on Cross-Validation Although out-of-sample validation is the gold standard in predictive modeling, it is not always practical to do so. The main reason is that we have limited sample sizes and the out-of-sample model selection criterion in equation (4.4) depends on a random split of the data. This means that different analysts, even when working the same data set and same approach to modeling, may select different models. This is likely in actuarial applications because we work with skewed data sets where there is a large chance of getting some very large outcomes and large outcomes may have a great influence on the parameter estimates. Cross-Validation Procedure. Alternatively, one may use cross-validation, as follows. The procedure begins by using a random mechanism to split the data into K subsets known as folds, where analysts typically use 5 to 10. Next, one uses the first K-1 subsamples to estimate model parameters. Then, “predict” the outcomes for the Kth subsample and use a measure such as in equation (4.4) to summarize the fit. Now, repeat this by holding out each of the K sub-samples, summarizing with a cumulative out-of-sample statistic. Repeat these steps for several candidate models and choose the model with the lowest cumulative out-of-sample statistic. Cross-validation is widely used because it retains the predictive flavor of the out-of-sample model validation process but, due to the re-use of the data, is more stable over random samples. Show Quiz Solution 4.3 Estimation using Modified Data In this section, you learn how to: Describe grouped, censored, and truncated data Estimate parametric distributions based on grouped, censored, and truncated data Estimate distributions nonparametrically based on grouped, censored, and truncated data 4.3.1 Parametric Estimation using Modified Data Basic theory and many applications are based on individual observations that are “complete” and “unmodified,” as we have seen in the previous section. Section 3.5 introduced the concept of observations that are “modified” due to two common types of limitations: censoring and truncation. For example, it is common to think about an insurance deductible as producing data that are truncated (from the left) or policy limits as yielding data that are censored (from the right). This viewpoint is from the primary insurer (the seller of the insurance). However, as we will see in Chapter 10, a reinsurer (an insurer of an insurance company) may not observe claims smaller than an amount, only that a claim exists, an example of censoring from the left. So, in this section, we cover the full gamut of alternatives. Specifically, this section will address parametric estimation methods for three alternatives to individual, complete, and unmodified data: interval-censored data available only in groups, data that are limited or censored, and data that may not be observed due to truncation. 4.3.1.1 Parametric Estimation using Grouped Data Consider a sample of size \\(n\\) observed from the distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\), but in groups so that we only know the group into which each observation fell, not the exact value. This is referred to as grouped or interval-censored data. For example, we may be looking at two successive years of annual employee records. People employed in the first year but not the second have left sometime during the year. With an exact departure date (individual data), we could compute the amount of time that they were with the firm. Without the departure date (grouped data), we only know that they departed sometime during a year-long interval. Formalizing this idea, suppose there are \\(k\\) groups or intervals delimited by boundaries \\(c_0 &lt; c_1&lt; \\cdots &lt; c_k\\). For each observation, we only observe the interval into which it fell (e.g. \\((c_{j-1}, c_j)\\)), not the exact value. Thus, we only know the number of observations in each interval. The constants \\(\\{c_0 &lt; c_1 &lt; \\cdots &lt; c_k\\}\\) form some partition of the domain of \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Then the probability of an observation \\(X_i\\) falling in the \\(j\\)th interval is \\[\\Pr\\left(X _i \\in (c_{j-1}, c_j]\\right) = F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1}).\\] The corresponding probability mass function for an observation is \\[ \\begin{aligned} f(x) &amp;= \\begin{cases} F(c_1) - F(c_{0}) &amp; \\text{if }\\ x \\in (c_{0}, c_1]\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ F(c_k) - F(c_{k-1}) &amp; \\text{if }\\ x \\in (c_{k-1}, c_k]\\\\ \\end{cases} \\\\ &amp;= \\prod_{j=1}^k \\left\\{F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1})\\right\\}^{I(x \\in (c_{j-1}, c_j])} \\end{aligned} \\] Now, define \\(n_j\\) to be the number of observations that fall in the \\(j\\)th interval, \\((c_{j-1}, c_j]\\). Thus, the likelihood functionA function of the likeliness of the parameters in a model, given the observed data. (with respect to the parameter(s) \\(\\theta\\)) is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\prod_{j=1}^n f(x_i) = \\prod_{j=1}^k \\left\\{F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1})\\right\\}^{n_j} \\end{aligned} \\] And the log-likelihood function is \\[ \\begin{aligned} L(\\theta) = \\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\ln \\prod_{j=1}^n f(x_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^k n_j \\ln \\left\\{F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1})\\right\\} \\end{aligned} \\] Maximizing the likelihood function (or equivalently, maximizing the log-likelihood function) would then produce the maximum likelihood estimates for grouped data. Example 4.3.1. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given: Losses follow an exponential distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\). A random sample of 20 losses is distributed as follows: \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l|c} \\hline \\text{Loss Range} &amp; \\text{Frequency} \\\\ \\hline [0,1000] &amp; 7 \\\\ (1000,2000] &amp; 6 \\\\ (2000,\\infty) &amp; 7 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) &amp;= F(1000)^7[F(2000)-F(1000)]^6[1-F(2000)]^7 \\\\ &amp;= (1-e^{-1000/\\theta})^7(e^{-1000/\\theta} - e^{-2000/\\theta})^6(e^{-2000/\\theta})^7 \\\\ &amp;= (1-p)^7(p-p^2)^6(p^2)^7 \\\\ &amp;= p^{20}(1-p)^{13} \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(p=e^{-1000/\\theta}\\). Maximizing this expression with respect to \\(p\\) is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood with respect to \\(\\theta\\). The maximum occurs at \\(p=\\frac{20}{33}\\) and so \\(\\hat{\\theta}=\\frac{-1000}{\\ln(20/33)}= 1996.90\\). 4.3.1.2 Censored Data Censoring occurs when we record only a limited value of an observation. The most common form is right-censoring, in which we record the smaller of the “true” dependent variable and a censoring variable. Using notation, let \\(X\\) represent an outcome of interest, such as the loss due to an insured event or time until an event. Let \\(C_U\\) denote the censoring amount. With right-censored observations, we record \\(X_U^{\\ast}= \\min(X, C_U) = X \\wedge C_U\\). We also record whether or not censoring has occurred. Let \\(\\delta_U= I(X \\leq C_U)\\) be a binary variable that is 0 if censoring occurs and 1 if it does not. For an example that we saw in Section 3.4.2, \\(C_U\\) may represent the upper limit of coverage of an insurance policy (we used \\(u\\) for the upper limit in that section). The loss may exceed the amount \\(C_U\\), but the insurer only has \\(C_U\\) in its records as the amount paid out and does not have the amount of the actual loss \\(X\\) in its records. Similarly, with left-censoring, we record the larger of a variable of interest and a censoring variable. If \\(C_L\\) is used to represent the censoring amount, we record \\(X_L^{\\ast}= \\max(X, C_L)\\) along with the censoring indicator \\(\\delta_L= I(X \\geq C_L)\\). As an example, you got a brief introduction to reinsurance, insurance for insurers, in Section 3.4.4 and will see more in Chapter 10. Suppose a reinsurer will cover insurer losses greater than \\(C_L\\); this means that the reinsurer is responsible for the excess of \\(X_L^{\\ast}\\) over \\(C_L\\). Using notation, this is \\(Y = X_L^{\\ast} - C_L\\). To see this, first consider the case where the policyholder loss \\(X &lt; C_L\\). Then, the insurer will pay the entire claim and \\(Y =C_L- C_L=0\\), no loss for the reinsurer. For the second case, if the loss \\(X \\ge C_L\\), then \\(Y = X-C_L\\) represents the reinsurer’s retained claims. Put another way, if a loss occurs, the reinsurer records the actual amount if it exceeds the limit \\(C_L\\) and otherwise it only records that it had a loss of \\(0\\). 4.3.1.3 Truncated Data Censored observations are recorded for study, although in a limited form. In contrast, truncated outcomes are a type of missing data. An outcome is potentially truncated when the availability of an observation depends on the outcome. In insurance, it is common for observations to be left-truncated at \\(C_L\\) when the amount is \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cl} \\text{we do not observe }X &amp; X &lt; C_L \\\\ X &amp; X \\geq C_L \\end{array} \\right.\\end{aligned} . \\] In other words, if \\(X\\) is less than the threshold \\(C_L\\), then it is not observed. For an example we saw in Section 3.4.1, \\(C_L\\) may represent the deductible of an insurance policy (we used \\(d\\) for the deductible in that section). If the insured loss is less than the deductible, then the insurer may not observe or record the loss at all. If the loss exceeds the deductible, then the excess \\(X-C_L\\) is the claim that the insurer covers. In Section 3.4.1, we defined the per payment loss to be \\[ Y^{P} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Undefined} &amp; X \\le d \\\\ X - d &amp; X &gt; d \\end{matrix} \\right. , \\] so that if a loss exceeds a deductible, we record the excess amount \\(X-d\\). This is very important when considering amounts that the insurer will pay. However, for estimation purposes of this section, it matters little if we substract a known constant such as \\(C_L=d\\). So, for our truncated variable \\(Y\\), we use the simpler convention and do not subract \\(d\\). Similarly for right-truncated data, if \\(X\\) exceeds a threshold \\(C_U\\), then it is not observed. In this case, the amount is \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cl} X &amp; X \\leq C_U \\\\ \\text{we do not observe }X &amp; X &gt; C_U. \\end{array} \\right.\\end{aligned} \\] Classic examples of truncation from the right include \\(X\\) as a measure of distance to a star. When the distance exceeds a certain level \\(C_U\\), the star is no longer observable. Figure 4.12 compares truncated and censored observations. Values of \\(X\\) that are greater than the “upper” censoring limit \\(C_U\\) are not observed at all (right-censored), while values of \\(X\\) that are smaller than the “lower” truncation limit \\(C_L\\) are observed, but observed as \\(C_L\\) rather than the actual value of \\(X\\) (left-truncated). Figure 4.12: Censoring and Truncation Show Mortality Study Example Example – Mortality Study. Suppose that you are conducting a two-year study of mortality of high-risk subjects, beginning January 1, 2010 and finishing January 1, 2012. Figure 4.13 graphically portrays the six types of subjects recruited. For each subject, the beginning of the arrow represents that the the subject was recruited and the arrow end represents the event time. Thus, the arrow represents exposure time. Figure 4.13: Timeline for Several Subjects on Test in a Mortality Study Type A - Right-censored. This subject is alive at the beginning and the end of the study. Because the time of death is not known by the end of the study, it is right-censored. Most subjects are Type A. Type B - Complete information is available for a type B subject. The subject is alive at the beginning of the study and the death occurs within the observation period. Type C - Right-censored and left-truncated. A type C subject is right-censored, in that death occurs after the observation period. However, the subject entered after the start of the study and is said to have a delayed entry time. Because the subject would not have been observed had death occurred before entry, it is left-truncated. Type D - Left-truncated. A type D subject also has delayed entry. Because death occurs within the observation period, this subject is not right censored. Type E - Left-truncated. A type E subject is not included in the study because death occurs prior to the observation period. Type F - Right-truncated. Similarly, a type F subject is not included because the entry time occurs after the observation period. To summarize, for outcome \\(X\\) and constants \\(C_L\\) and \\(C_U\\), Limitation Type Limited Variable Recording Information right censoring \\(X_U^{\\ast}= \\min(X, C_U)\\) \\(\\delta_U= I(X \\leq C_U)\\) left censoring \\(X_L^{\\ast}= \\max(X, C_L)\\) \\(\\delta_L= I(X \\geq C_L)\\) interval censoring right truncation \\(X\\) observe \\(X\\) if \\(X \\leq C_U\\) left truncation \\(X\\) observe \\(X\\) if \\(X \\geq C_L\\) 4.3.1.4 Parametric Estimation using Censored and Truncated Data For simplicity, we assume non-random censoring amounts and a continuous outcome \\(X\\). To begin, consider the case of right-censored data where we record \\(X_U^{\\ast}= \\min(X, C_U)\\) and censoring indicator \\(\\delta= I(X \\leq C_U)\\). If censoring occurs so that \\(\\delta=0\\), then \\(X \\geq C_U\\) and the likelihood is \\(\\Pr(X \\geq C_U) = 1-F(C_U)\\). If censoring does not occur so that \\(\\delta=1\\), then \\(X &lt; C_U\\) and the likelihood is \\(f(x)\\). Summarizing, we have the likelihood of a single observation as \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1-F(C_U) &amp; \\text{if }\\delta=0 \\\\ f(x) &amp; \\text{if } \\delta = 1 \\end{array} \\right. = \\left\\{ f(x)\\right\\}^{\\delta} \\left\\{1-F(C_U)\\right\\}^{1-\\delta} . \\end{aligned} \\] The right-hand expression allows us to present the likelihood more compactly. Now, for an iid sample of size \\(n\\), the likelihood is \\[ \\mathcal{L} = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left\\{ f(x_i)\\right\\}^{\\delta_i} \\left\\{1-F(C_{Ui})\\right\\}^{1-\\delta_i} = \\prod_{\\delta_i=1} f(x_i) \\prod_{\\delta_i=0} \\{1-F(C_{Ui})\\}, \\] with potential censoring times \\(\\{ C_{U1}, \\ldots,C_{Un} \\}\\). Here, the notation “\\(\\prod_{\\delta_i=1}\\)” means to take the product over uncensored observations, and similarly for “\\(\\prod_{\\delta_i=0}\\).” On the other hand, truncated data are handled in likelihood inference via conditional probabilities. Specifically, we adjust the likelihood contribution by dividing by the probability that the variable was observed. To summarize, we have the following contributions to the likelihood function for six types of outcomes: \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{lc} \\hline \\text{Outcome} &amp; \\text{Likelihood Contribution} \\\\ \\hline \\text{exact value} &amp; f(x) \\\\ \\text{right-censoring} &amp; 1-F(C_U) \\\\ \\text{left-censoring} &amp; F(C_L) \\\\ \\text{right-truncation} &amp; f(x)/F(C_U) \\\\ \\text{left-truncation} &amp; f(x)/(1-F(C_L)) \\\\ \\text{interval-censoring} &amp; F(C_U)-F(C_L) \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] For known outcomes and censored data, the likelihood is \\[\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\prod_{E} f(x_i) \\prod_{R} \\{1-F(C_{Ui})\\} \\prod_{L} F(C_{Li}) \\prod_{I} (F(C_{Ui})-F(C_{Li})),\\] where “\\(\\prod_{E}\\)” is the product over observations with Exact values, and similarly for Right-, Left- and Interval-censoring. For right-censored and left-truncated data, the likelihood is \\[\\mathcal{L} = \\prod_{E} \\frac{f(x_i)}{1-F(C_{Li})} \\prod_{R} \\frac{1-F(C_{Ui})}{1-F(C_{Li})},\\] and similarly for other combinations. To get further insights, consider the following. Show Special Case - Exponential Distribution Special Case: Exponential Distribution. Consider data that are right-censored and left-truncated, with random variables \\(X_i\\) that are exponentially distributed with mean \\(\\theta\\). With these specifications, recall that \\(f(x) = \\theta^{-1} \\exp(-x/\\theta)\\) and \\(F(x) = 1-\\exp(-x/\\theta)\\). For this special case, the log-likelihood is \\[ \\begin{aligned} L(\\theta) &amp;= \\sum_{E} \\left\\{ \\ln f(x_i) - \\ln (1-F(C_{Li})) \\right\\} + \\sum_{R}\\left\\{ \\ln (1-F(C_{Ui}))- \\ln (1-\\mathrm{F}(C_{Li})) \\right\\}\\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{E} (-\\ln \\theta -(x_i-C_{Li})/\\theta ) -\\sum_{R} (C_{Ui}-C_{Li})/\\theta . \\end{aligned} \\] To simplify the notation, define \\(\\delta_i = I(X_i \\geq C_{Ui})\\) to be a binary variable that indicates right-censoring. Let \\(X_i^{\\ast \\ast} = \\min(X_i, C_{Ui}) - C_{Li}\\) be the amount that the observed variable exceeds the lower truncation limit. With this, the log-likelihood is \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\theta) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n ((1-\\delta_i) \\ln \\theta + \\frac{x_i^{\\ast \\ast}}{\\theta}) \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] Taking derivatives with respect to the parameter \\(\\theta\\) and setting it equal to zero yields the maximum likelihood estimator \\[\\widehat{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{n_u} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^{\\ast \\ast},\\] where \\(n_u = \\sum_i (1-\\delta_i)\\) is the number of uncensored observations. Example 4.3.2. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given: A sample of losses is: 600 700 900 No information is available about losses of 500 or less. Losses are assumed to follow an exponential distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\). Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution. These observations are truncated at 500. The contribution of each observation to the likelihood function is \\[\\frac{f(x)}{1-F(500)} = \\frac{\\theta^{-1}e^{-x/\\theta}}{e^{-500/\\theta}}\\] Then the likelihood function is \\[\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)= \\frac{\\theta^{-1} e^{-600/\\theta} \\theta^{-1} e^{-700/\\theta} \\theta^{-1} e^{-900/\\theta}}{(e^{-500/\\theta})^3} = \\theta^{-3}e^{-700/\\theta}\\] The log-likelihood is \\[L(\\theta) = \\ln\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = -3\\ln \\theta - 700\\theta^{-1}\\] Maximizing this expression by setting the derivative with respect to \\(\\theta\\) equal to 0, we have \\[L&#39;(\\theta) = -3\\theta^{-1} + 700\\theta^{-2} = 0 \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{700}{3} = 233.33\\] Example 4.3.3. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given the following information about a random sample: The sample size equals five. The sample is from a Weibull distribution with \\(\\tau=2\\). Two of the sample observations are known to exceed 50, and the remaining three observations are 20, 30, and 45. Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The likelihood function is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) &amp;= f(20) f(30) f(45) [1-F(50)]^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2(20/\\theta)^2 e^{-(20/\\theta)^2}}{20} \\frac{2(30/\\theta)^2 e^{-(30/\\theta)^2}}{30} \\frac{2(45/\\theta)^2 e^{-(45/\\theta)^2}}{45}(e^{-(50/\\theta)^2})^2 \\\\ &amp;\\propto \\frac{1}{\\theta^6} e^{-8325/\\theta^2} \\end{aligned} \\] The natural logarithm of the above expression is \\(-6\\ln\\theta - \\frac{8325}{\\theta^2}\\). Maximizing this expression by setting its derivative to 0, we get \\[\\frac{-6}{\\theta} + \\frac{16650}{\\theta^3} = 0 \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\hat{\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{16650}{6}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 52.6783\\] 4.3.2 Nonparametric Estimation using Modified Data Nonparametric estimators provide useful benchmarks, so it is helpful to understand the estimation procedures for grouped, censored, and truncated data. 4.3.2.1 Grouped Data As we have seen in Section 4.3.1.1, observations may be grouped (also referred to as interval censored) in the sense that we only observe them as belonging in one of \\(k\\) intervals of the form \\((c_{j-1}, c_j]\\), for \\(j=1, \\ldots, k\\). At the boundaries, the empirical distribution function is defined in the usual way: \\[ F_n(c_j) = \\frac{\\text{number of observations } \\le c_j}{n}. \\] For other values of \\(x \\in (c_{j-1}, c_j)\\), we can estimate the distribution function with the ogive estimatorA nonparametric estimator for the distribution function in the presence of grouped data., which linearly interpolates between \\(F_n(c_{j-1})\\) and \\(F_n(c_j)\\), i.e. the values of the boundaries \\(F_n(c_{j-1})\\) and \\(F_n(c_j)\\) are connected with a straight line. This can formally be expressed as \\[F_n(x) = \\frac{c_j-x}{c_j-c_{j-1}} F_n(c_{j-1}) + \\frac{x-c_{j-1}}{c_j-c_{j-1}} F_n(c_j) \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } c_{j-1} \\le x &lt; c_j\\] The corresponding density is \\[f_n(x) = F^{\\prime}_n(x) = \\frac{F_n(c_j)-F_n(c_{j-1})}{c_j - c_{j-1}} \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } c_{j-1} \\le x &lt; c_j .\\] Example 4.3.4. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given the following information regarding claim sizes for 100 claims: \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{r|c} \\hline \\text{Claim Size} &amp; \\text{Number of Claims} \\\\ \\hline 0 - 1,000 &amp; 16 \\\\ 1,000 - 3,000 &amp; 22 \\\\ 3,000 - 5,000 &amp; 25 \\\\ 5,000 - 10,000 &amp; 18 \\\\ 10,000 - 25,000 &amp; 10 \\\\ 25,000 - 50,000 &amp; 5 \\\\ 50,000 - 100,000 &amp; 3 \\\\ \\text{over } 100,000 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Using the ogive, calculate the estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen claim is between 2000 and 6000. Show Example Solution Solution. At the boundaries, the empirical distribution function is defined in the usual way, so we have \\[F_{100}(1000) = 0.16, \\ F_{100}(3000)=0.38, \\ F_{100}(5000)=0.63, \\ F_{100}(10000)=0.81\\] For other claim sizes, the ogive estimator linearly interpolates between these values: \\[F_{100}(2000) = 0.5F_{100}(1000) + 0.5F_{100}(3000) = 0.5(0.16)+0.5(0.38)=0.27\\] \\[F_{100}(6000)=0.8F_{100}(5000)+0.2F_{100}(10000) = 0.8(0.63)+0.2(0.81)=0.666\\] Thus, the probability that a claim is between 2000 and 6000 is \\(F_{100}(6000) - F_{100}(2000) = 0.666-0.27 = 0.396\\). 4.3.2.2 Right-Censored Empirical Distribution Function It can be useful to calibrate parametric estimators with nonparametric methods that do not rely on a parametric form of the distribution. The product-limit estimatorA nonparametric estimator of the survival function in the presence of incomplete data. also known as the kaplan-meier estimator. due to (Kaplan and Meier 1958) is a well-known estimator of the distribution function in the presence of censoring. Motivation for the Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimator. To explain why the product-limit works so well with censored observations, let us first return to the “usual” case without censoring. Here, the empirical distribution function \\(F_n(x)\\) is an unbiased estimator of the distribution function \\(F(x)\\). This is because \\(F_n(x)\\) is the average of indicator variables each of which are unbiased, that is, \\(\\mathrm{E~} I(X_i \\le x) = \\Pr(X_i \\le x) = F(x)\\). Now suppose the the random outcome is censored on the right by a limiting amount, say, \\(C_U\\), so that we record the smaller of the two, \\(X^* = \\min(X, C_U)\\). For values of \\(x\\) that are smaller than \\(C_U\\), the indicator variable still provides an unbiased estimator of the distribution function before we reach the censoring limit. That is, \\(\\mathrm{E~} I(X^* \\le x) = F(x)\\) because \\(I(X^* \\le x) = I(X \\le x)\\) for \\(x &lt; C_U\\). In the same way, \\(\\mathrm{E~} I(X^* &gt; x) = 1 -F(x) = S(x)\\). But, for \\(x&gt;C_U\\), \\(I(X^* \\le x)\\) is in general not an unbiased estimator of \\(F(x)\\). As an alternative, consider two random variables that have different censoring limits. For illustration, suppose that we observe \\(X_1^* = \\min(X_1, 5)\\) and \\(X_2^* = \\min(X_2, 10)\\) where \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are independent draws from the same distribution. For \\(x \\le 5\\), the empirical distribution function \\(F_2(x)\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(F(x)\\). However, for \\(5 &lt; x \\le 10\\), the first observation cannot be used for the distribution function because of the censoring limitation. Instead, the strategy developed by (Kaplan and Meier 1958) is to use \\(S_2(5)\\) as an estimator of \\(S(5)\\) and then to use the second observation to estimate the survival function conditional on survival to time 5, \\(\\Pr(X &gt; x | X &gt;5) = \\frac{S(x)}{S(5)}\\). Specifically, for \\(5 &lt; x \\le 10\\), the estimator of the survival function is \\[ \\hat{S}(x) = S_2(5) \\times I(X_2^* &gt; x ) . \\] Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimator. Extending this idea, for each observation \\(i\\), let \\(u_i\\) be the upper censoring limit (\\(=\\infty\\) if no censoring). Thus, the recorded value is \\(x_i\\) in the case of no censoring and \\(u_i\\) if there is censoring. Let \\(t_{1} &lt;\\cdots&lt; t_{k}\\) be \\(k\\) distinct points at which an uncensored loss occurs, and let \\(s_j\\) be the number of uncensored losses \\(x_i\\)’s at \\(t_{j}\\). The corresponding risk setThe number of observations that are active (not censored) at a specific point. is the number of observations that are active (not censored) at a value less than \\(t_{j}\\), denoted as \\(R_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n I(x_i \\geq t_{j}) + \\sum_{i=1}^n I(u_i \\geq t_{j})\\). With this notation, the product-limit estimator of the distribution function is \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{F}(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 &amp; x&lt;t_{1} \\\\ 1-\\prod_{j:t_{j} \\leq x}\\left( 1-\\frac{s_j}{R_{j}}\\right) &amp; x \\geq t_{1} \\end{array} \\right. .\\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] As usual, the corresponding estimate of the survival function is \\(\\hat{S}(x) = 1 - \\hat{F}(x)\\). Example 4.3.5. Actuarial Exam Question. The following is a sample of 10 payments: \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccccccc} 4 &amp;4 &amp;5+ &amp;5+ &amp;5+ &amp;8 &amp;10+ &amp;10+ &amp;12 &amp;15 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] where \\(+\\) indicates that a loss has exceeded the policy limit. Using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator, calculate the probability that the loss on a policy exceeds 11, \\(\\hat{S}(11)\\). Show Example Solution Solution. There are four event times (non-censored observations). For each time \\(t_j\\), we can calculate the number of events \\(s_j\\) and the risk set \\(R_j\\) as the following: \\[ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\hline j &amp; t_j &amp; s_j &amp; R_j \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 10 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 \\\\ 3 &amp; 12 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 4 &amp; 15 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Thus, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of \\(S(11)\\) is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{S}(11) &amp;= \\prod_{j:t_j\\leq 11} \\left( 1- \\frac{s_j}{R_j} \\right) = \\prod_{j=1}^{2} \\left( 1- \\frac{s_j}{R_j} \\right)\\\\ &amp;= \\left(1-\\frac{2}{10} \\right) \\left(1-\\frac{1}{5} \\right) = (0.8)(0.8)= 0.64. \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Example. 4.3.6. Bodily Injury Claims. We consider again the Boston auto bodily injury claims data from Derrig, Ostaszewski, and Rempala (2001) that was introduced in Example 4.1.11. In that example, we omitted the 17 claims that were censored by policy limits. Now, we include the full dataset and use the Kaplan-Meier product limit to estimate the survival function. This is given in Figure 4.14.

As before, for each observation \\(i\\), let \\(u_i\\) be the upper censoring limit (\\(=\\infty\\) if no censoring). Further, let \\(d_i\\) be the lower truncation limit (0 if no truncation). Thus, the recorded value (if it is greater than \\(d_i\\)) is \\(x_i\\) in the case of no censoring and \\(u_i\\) if there is censoring. Let \\(t_{1} &lt;\\cdots&lt; t_{k}\\) be \\(k\\) distinct points at which an event of interest occurs, and let \\(s_j\\) be the number of recorded events \\(x_i\\)’s at time point \\(t_{j}\\). The corresponding risk set is \\[R_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n I(x_i \\geq t_{j}) + \\sum_{i=1}^n I(u_i \\geq t_{j}) - \\sum_{i=1}^n I(d_i \\geq t_{j}).\\] With this new definition of the risk set, the product-limit estimator of the distribution function is as in equation (4.6). Greenwood’s Formula. (Greenwood 1926) derived the formula for the estimated variance of the product-limit estimator to be \\[\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{F}(x)) = (1-\\hat{F}(x))^{2} \\sum _{j:t_{j} \\leq x} \\dfrac{s_j}{R_{j}(R_{j}-s_j)}.\\] R‘s survfit method takes a survival data object and creates a new object containing the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function along with confidence intervals. The Kaplan-Meier method (type='kaplan-meier') is used by default to construct an estimate of the survival curve. The resulting discrete survival function has point masses at the observed event times (discharge dates) \\(t_j\\), where the probability of an event given survival to that duration is estimated as the number of observed events at the duration \\(s_j\\) divided by the number of subjects exposed or ’at-risk’ just prior to the event duration \\(R_j\\). Two alternate types of estimation are also available for the survfit method. The alternative (type='fh2') handles ties, in essence, by assuming that multiple events at the same duration occur in some arbitrary order. Another alternative (type='fleming-harrington') uses the Nelson-AalenA nonparametric estimator of the cumulative hazard function in the presence of incomplete data. (see (Aalen 1978)) estimate of the cumulative hazard function to obtain an estimate of the survival function. The estimated cumulative hazard \\(\\hat{H}(x)\\) starts at zero and is incremented at each observed event duration \\(t_j\\) by the number of events \\(s_j\\) divided by the number at risk \\(R_j\\). With the same notation as above, the Nelson-Äalen estimator of the distribution function is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{F}_{NA}(x) &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 &amp; x&lt;t_{1} \\\\ 1- \\exp \\left(-\\sum_{j:t_{j} \\leq x}\\frac{s_j}{R_j} \\right) &amp; x \\geq t_{1} \\end{array} \\right. .\\end{aligned} \\] Note that the above expression is a result of the Nelson-Äalen estimator of the cumulative hazard function \\[\\hat{H}(x)=\\sum_{j:t_j\\leq x} \\frac{s_j}{R_j} \\] and the relationship between the survival function and cumulative hazard function, \\(\\hat{S}_{NA}(x)=e^{-\\hat{H}(x)}\\). Example 4.3.7. Actuarial Exam Question.

Summarize posterior distributions of parameters and use these posterior distributions to predict new outcomes. Use conjugate distributions to determine posterior distributions of parameters. 4.4.1 Introduction to Bayesian Inference Up to this point, our inferential methods have focused on the frequentist setting, in which samples are repeatedly drawn from a population. The vector of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) is fixed yet unknown, whereas the outcomes \\(X\\) are realizations of random variables. In contrast, under the BayesianA type of statistical inference in which the model parameters and the data are random variables. framework, we view both the model parameters and the data as random variables. We are uncertain about the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) and use probability tools to reflect this uncertainty. To get a sense of the Bayesian framework, begin by recalling Bayes’ rule \\[ \\Pr(parameters|data) = \\frac{\\Pr(data|parameters) \\times \\Pr(parameters)}{\\Pr(data)} \\] where \\(\\Pr(parameters)\\) is the distribution of the parameters, known as the prior distribution. \\(\\Pr(data | parameters)\\) is the sampling distribution. In a frequentist context, it is used for making inferences about the parameters and is known as the likelihood. \\(\\Pr(parameters | data)\\) is the distribution of the parameters having observed the data, known as the posterior distribution. \\(\\Pr(data)\\) is the marginal distribution of the data. It is generally obtained by integrating (or summing) the joint distribution of data and parameters over parameter values. Why Bayes? There are several advantages of the Bayesian approach. First, we can describe the entire distribution of parameters conditional on the data. This allows us, for example, to provide probability statements regarding the likelihood of parameters. Second, the Bayesian approach provides a unified approach for estimating parameters. Some non-Bayesian methods, such as least squaresA technique for estimating parameters in linear regression. it is a standard approach in regression analysis to the approximate solution of overdetermined systems. in this technique, one determines the parameters that minimize the sum of squared differences between each observation and the corresponding linear combination of explanatory variables., require a separate approach to estimate variance components. In contrast, in Bayesian methods, all parameters can be treated in a similar fashion. This is convenient for explaining results to consumers of the data analysis. Third, this approach allows analysts to blend prior information known from other sources with the data in a coherent manner. This topic is developed in detail in the credibilityAn actuarial method of balancing an individual’s loss experience and the experience in the overall portfolio to improve ratemaking estimates. chapter. Fourth, Bayesian analysis is particularly useful for forecasting future responses. Poisson - Gamma Special Case. To develop intuition, we consider the Poisson-Gamma case that holds a prominent position in actuarial applications. The idea is to consider a set of random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) where each \\(X_i\\) could represent the number of claims for the ith policyholder. Assume that \\(X_i\\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\), analogous to the likelihood that we first saw in Chapter 2. In a non-Bayesian (or frequentist) context, the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is viewed as an unknown quantity that is not random (it is said to be “fixed”). In the Bayesian context, the unknown parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is viewed as uncertain and is modeled as a random variable. In this special case, we use the gamma distribution to reflect this uncertainty, the prior distributionThe distribution of the parameters prior to observing data under the bayesian framework.. Think of the following two-stage sampling scheme to motivate our probabilistic set-up. In the first stage, the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is drawn from a gamma distribution. In the second stage, for that value of \\(\\lambda\\), there are \\(n\\) draws from the same (identical) Poisson distribution that are independent, conditional on \\(\\lambda\\). From this simple set-up, some important conclusions emerge. The distribution of \\(X_i\\) is no longer Poisson. For a special case, it turns out to be a negative binomial distribution (see the following “Snippet of Theory”). The random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) are not independent. This is because they share the common random variable \\(\\lambda\\). As in the frequentist context, the goal is to make statments about likely values of parameters such as \\(\\lambda\\) given the observed data \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). However, because now both the parameter and the data are random variables, we can use the language of conditional probability to make such statements. As we will see in Section 4.4.4, it turns out that the distribution of \\(\\lambda\\) given the data \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) is also gamma (with updated parameters), a result that simplifies the task of inferring likely values of the parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Show A Snippet of Theory Let us demonstrate that the distribution of \\(X\\) is negative binomial. We assume that the distribution of \\(X\\) given \\(\\lambda\\) is Poisson, so that \\[ \\Pr(X = x|\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^x}{\\Gamma(x+1)} e^{-\\lambda} , \\] using notation \\(\\Gamma(x+1) = x!\\) for integer \\(x\\). Assume that \\(\\lambda\\) is a draw from a gamma distribution with fixed parameters, say, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\), so this has pdf \\[ f(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}}{\\theta^{\\alpha}\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\exp(-\\lambda/\\theta). \\] We know that a pdf integrates to one. To make the development easier, define the reciprocal parameter \\(\\theta_r = 1/\\theta\\) and so we have \\[ \\int_0^{\\infty} f(\\lambda) ~d\\lambda =1 ~~~ ==&gt; ~~~ \\theta_r^{-\\alpha} \\Gamma(\\alpha) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\lambda^{\\alpha-1} \\exp\\left(-\\lambda\\theta_r\\right) ~ d\\lambda . \\] From Appendix Chapter 16 on iterated expectations, we have that the pmfProbability mass function of \\(X\\) can be computed in an iterated fashion as \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(X = x) &amp;= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{\\Pr(X = x|\\lambda)\\right\\}\\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\Pr(X = x|\\lambda) f(\\lambda) ~d\\lambda \\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^x}{\\Gamma(x+1)} e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}}{\\theta^{\\alpha}\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\exp(-\\lambda/\\theta) ~d\\lambda\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\theta^{\\alpha}\\Gamma(x+1)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\lambda^{x+\\alpha-1} \\exp\\left(-\\lambda(1+\\frac{1}{\\theta})\\right) ~d\\lambda \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\theta^{\\alpha}\\Gamma(x+1)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\Gamma(x+\\alpha)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)^{-(x+\\alpha)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\Gamma(x+\\alpha)}{\\Gamma(x+1)\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{x} .\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Here, we used the gamma distribution equality with the substitution \\(\\theta_r = 1 + 1/\\theta\\). As can be seen from Section 2.2.3.3, this is a negative binomial distribution with parameter \\(r = \\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta = \\theta\\). In this chapter, we use small examples that can be done by hand in order to focus on the foundations. For practical implementation, analysts rely heavily on simulation methods using modern computational methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulationThe class of numerical methods that use markov chains to generate draws from a posterior distribution.. We will get an exposure to simulation techniques in Chapter 6 but more intensive techniques such as MCMC requires yet more background. See Hartman (2016) for an introduction to computational Bayesian methods from an actuarial perspective. 4.4.2 Bayesian Model With the intuition developed in the preceding Section 4.4.1, we now restate the Bayesian model with a bit more precision using mathematical notation. For simplicity, this summary assumes both the outcomes and parameters are continuous random variables. In the examples, we sometimes ask the viewer to apply these same principles to discrete versions. Conceptually both the continuous and discrete cases are the same; mechanically, one replaces a pdf by a pmf and an integral by a sum. As stated earlier, under the Bayesian perspective, the model parameters and data are both viewed as random. Our uncertainty about the parameters of the underlying data generating process is reflected in the use of probability tools. Prior Distribution. Specifically, think about parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) as a random vector and let \\(\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) denote the distribution of possible outcomes. This is knowledge that we have before outcomes are observed and is called the prior distribution. Typically, the prior distribution is a regular distribution and so integrates or sums to one, depending on whether \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) is continuous or discrete. However, we may be very uncertain (or have no clue) about the distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\); the Bayesian machinery allows the following situation \\[\\int \\pi(\\theta) d\\theta = \\infty,\\] in which case \\(\\pi(\\cdot)\\) is called an improper priorA prior distribution in which the sum or integral of the distribution is not finite.. Model Distribution. The distribution of outcomes given an assumed value of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) is known as the model distribution and denoted as \\(f(x | \\boldsymbol \\theta) = f_{X|\\boldsymbol \\theta} (x|\\boldsymbol \\theta )\\). This is the usual frequentist mass or density function. This is simply the likelihood in the frequentist context and so it is also convenient to use this as a descriptor for the model distribution. Joint Distribution. The distribution of outcomes and model parameters is, unsurprisingly, known as the joint distribution and denoted as \\(f(x , \\boldsymbol \\theta) = f(x|\\boldsymbol \\theta )\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Marginal Outcome Distribution. The distribution of outcomes can be expressed as \\[f(x) = \\int f(x | \\boldsymbol \\theta)\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta) ~d \\boldsymbol \\theta.\\] This is analogous to a frequentist mixture distribution. In the mixture distribution, we combined (or “mixed”) different subpopulations. In the Bayesian context, the marginal distribution is a combination of different realizations of parameters (in some literatures, you can think about this as combining different “states of nature”). Posterior Distribution of Parameters. After outcomes have been observed (hence the terminology “posterior”), one can use Bayes theorem to write the distribution as \\[\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta | x) =\\frac{f(x , \\boldsymbol \\theta)}{f(x)} =\\frac{f(x|\\boldsymbol \\theta )\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{f(x)}\\] The idea is to update your knowledge of the distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) (\\(\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\)) with the data \\(x\\). Making statements about potential values of parameters is an important aspect of statistical inference. 4.4.3 Bayesian Inference 4.4.3.1 Summarizing the Posterior Distribution of Parameters One way to summarize a distribution is to use a confidence intervalAnother term for interval estimate. unlike a point estimate, it gives a range of reliability for approximating a parameter of interest. type statement. To summarize the posterior distribution of parameters, the interval \\([a,b]\\) is said to be a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) credibility intervalA summary of the posterior distribution of parameters under the bayesian framework. for \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) if \\[\\Pr (a \\le \\theta \\le b | \\mathbf{x}) \\ge 1- \\alpha.\\] For another approach to summarization, we can look to classical decision analysisBayesian decision theory is the study of an agent’s choices, which is informed by bayesian probability.. In this set-up, the loss function \\(l(\\hat{\\theta}, \\theta)\\) determines the penalty paid for using the estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) instead of the true \\(\\theta\\). The Bayes estimate is the value that minimizes the expected loss \\(\\mathrm{E~}[ l(\\hat{\\theta}, \\theta)]\\). Some important special cases include: \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{cll} \\hline \\text{Loss function } l(\\hat{\\theta}, \\theta) &amp; \\text{Descriptor} &amp; \\text{Bayes Estimate} \\\\ \\hline (\\hat{\\theta}- \\theta)^2 &amp; \\text{squared error loss} &amp; \\mathrm{E}(\\theta|X) \\\\ |\\hat{\\theta}- \\theta| &amp; \\text{absolute deviation loss} &amp; \\text{median of } \\pi(\\theta|x) \\\\ I(\\hat{\\theta} =\\theta) &amp; \\text{zero-one loss (for discrete probabilities)} &amp; \\text{mode of } \\pi(\\theta|x) \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Minimizing expected loss is a rigorous method for providing a single “best guess” about a likely value of a parameter, comparable to a frequentist estimator of the unknown (fixed) parameter. Example 4.4.1. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given: In a portfolio of risks, each policyholder can have at most one claim per year. The probability of a claim for a policyholder during a year is \\(q\\). The prior density is \\[\\pi(q) = q^3/0.07, \\ \\ \\ 0.6 &lt; q &lt; 0.8\\] A randomly selected policyholder has one claim in Year 1 and zero claims in Year 2. For this policyholder, calculate the posterior probability that \\(0.7 &lt; q &lt; 0.8\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The posterior density is proportional to the product of the likelihood function and prior density. Thus, \\[\\pi(q|1,0) \\propto f(1|q)\\ f(0|q)\\ \\pi(q) \\propto q(1-q)q^3 = q^4-q^5\\] To get the exact posterior density, we integrate the above function over its range \\((0.6, 0.8)\\) \\[\\int_{0.6}^{0.8} q^4-q^5 dq = \\frac{q^5}{5} - \\left. \\frac{q^6}{6} \\right|_{0.6}^{0.8} = 0.014069 \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\pi(q|1,0)=\\frac{q^4-q^5}{0.014069}\\] Then \\[\\Pr(0.7&lt;q&lt;0.8|1,0)= \\int_{0.7}^{0.8} \\frac{q^4-q^5}{0.014069}dq = 0.5572\\] Example 4.4.2.

Specifically, for new data \\(y\\), the predictive distributionThe distribution of new data, conditional on a base set of data, under the bayesian framework. is \\[f(y|x) = \\int f(y|\\theta) \\pi(\\theta|x) d\\theta .\\] It is also sometimes called a “posterior” distribution as the distribution of the new data is conditional on a base set of data. Using squared error loss for the loss function, the Bayesian prediction of \\(Y\\) is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E}(Y|X) &amp;= \\int ~y f(y|X) dy = \\int y \\left(\\int f(y|\\theta) \\pi(\\theta|X) d\\theta \\right) dy \\\\ &amp;= \\int \\mathrm{E}(Y|\\theta) \\pi(\\theta|X) ~d\\theta . \\end{aligned} \\] As noted earlier, for some situations the distribution of parameters is discrete, not continuous. Having a discrete set of possible parameters allow us to think of them as alternative “states of nature,” a helpful interpretation. Example 4.4.3. Actuarial Exam Question. For a particular policy, the conditional probability of the annual number of claims given \\(\\Theta = \\theta\\), and the probability distribution of \\(\\Theta\\) are as follows: \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l|ccc} \\hline \\text{Number of Claims} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ \\text{Probability} &amp; 2\\theta &amp; \\theta &amp; 1-3\\theta \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l|cc} \\hline \\theta &amp; 0.05 &amp; 0.30 \\\\ \\text{Probability} &amp; 0.80 &amp; 0.20 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Two claims are observed in Year 1.

From the model distribution, we have \\[ E(X|\\theta) = 0 \\times 2\\theta + 1 \\times \\theta + 2 \\times (1-3\\theta) = 2 - 5 \\theta. \\] Thus, \\[ \\begin{aligned} E(Y|X) &amp;= \\sum_{\\theta} \\mathrm{E}(Y|\\theta) \\pi(\\theta|X) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathrm{E}(Y|\\theta=0.05) \\pi(\\theta=0.05|X)+\\mathrm{E}(Y|\\theta=0.3) \\pi(\\theta=0.3|X)\\\\ &amp;= ( 2 - 5 (0.05))\\frac{68}{70} + ( 2 - 5 (0.3))\\frac{2}{70} = 1.714. \\end{aligned} \\] Example 4.4.4. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given: Losses on a company’s insurance policies follow a Pareto distribution with probability density function: \\[ f(x|\\theta) = \\frac{\\theta}{(x+\\theta)^2}, \\ \\ 0 &lt; x &lt; \\infty \\] For half of the company’s policies \\(\\theta=1\\) , while for the other half \\(\\theta=3\\). For a randomly selected policy, losses in Year 1 were 5. Calculate the posterior probability that losses for this policy in Year 2 will exceed 8. Show Example Solution Solution. We are given the prior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) as \\(\\Pr(\\theta=1)=\\Pr(\\theta=3)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), the conditional distribution \\(f(x|\\theta)\\), and the fact that we observed \\(X_1=5\\). The goal is to find the predictive probability \\(\\Pr(X_2&gt;8|X_1=5)\\). The posterior probabilities are \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(\\theta=1|X_1=5) &amp;= \\frac{f(5|\\theta=1)\\Pr(\\theta=1)}{f(5|\\theta=1)\\Pr(\\theta=1) + f(5|\\theta=3)\\Pr(\\theta=3)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{36}(\\frac{1}{2})}{\\frac{1}{36}(\\frac{1}{2})+\\frac{3}{64}(\\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{72}}{\\frac{1}{72} + \\frac{3}{128}} = \\frac{16}{43} \\end{aligned} \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(\\theta=3|X_1=5) &amp;= \\frac{f(5|\\theta=3)\\Pr(\\theta=3)}{f(5|\\theta=1)\\Pr(\\theta=1) + f(5|\\theta=3)\\Pr(\\theta=3)} \\\\ &amp;= 1-\\Pr(\\theta=1|X_1=5) = \\frac{27}{43} \\end{aligned} \\] Note that the conditional probability that losses exceed 8 is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(X_2&gt;8|\\theta) &amp;= \\int_8^\\infty f(x|\\theta)dx \\\\ &amp;= \\int_8^\\infty \\frac{\\theta}{(x+\\theta)^2}dx = \\left. -\\frac{\\theta}{x+\\theta} \\right|_8^\\infty = \\frac{\\theta}{8 + \\theta} \\end{aligned} \\] The predictive probability is therefore \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(X_2&gt;8|X_1=5) &amp;= \\Pr(X_2&gt;8|\\theta=1) \\Pr(\\theta=1|X_1=5) + \\Pr(X_2&gt;8|\\theta=3) \\Pr(\\theta=3 | X_1=5) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{8+1}\\left( \\frac{16}{43}\\right) + \\frac{3}{8+3} \\left( \\frac{27}{43}\\right) = 0.2126 \\end{aligned} \\] Example 4.4.5.

As described in Section 4.4.1, modern data analysis using Bayesian methods utilize computationally intensive techniques such as MCMCMarkov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Another approach for computing posterior distributions are based on conjugate distributions. Although this approach is available only for a limited number of distributions, it has the appeal that it provides closed-form expressions for the distributions, allowing for easy interpretations of results. To relate the prior and posterior distributions of the parameters, we have the relationship \\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta | x) &amp; = &amp; \\frac{f(x|\\boldsymbol \\theta )\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{f(x)} \\\\ &amp; \\propto &amp; f(x|\\boldsymbol \\theta ) \\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\\\ \\text{Posterior} &amp; \\text{is proportional to} &amp; \\text{likelihood} \\times \\text{prior} . \\end{array} \\] For conjugate distributions, the posterior and the prior come from the same family of distributions. The following illustration looks at the Poisson-gamma special case, the most well-known in actuarial applications. Special Case – Poisson-Gamma - Continued. Assume a Poisson(\\(\\lambda\\)) model distribution and that \\(\\lambda\\) follows a gamma(\\(\\alpha, \\theta\\)) prior distribution. Then, the posterior distribution of \\(\\lambda\\) given the data follows a gamma distribution with new parameters \\(\\alpha_{post} = \\sum_i x_i + \\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta_{post} = 1/(n + 1/\\theta)\\). Show Special Case Details Special Case – Poisson-Gamma - Continued. The model distribution is \\[f(\\mathbf{x} | \\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\lambda^{x_i} e^{-\\lambda}}{x_i!} .\\] The prior distribution is \\[\\pi(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\left(\\lambda/\\theta\\right)^{\\alpha} \\exp(-\\lambda/\\theta)}{\\lambda \\Gamma(\\alpha)}.\\] Thus, the posterior distribution is proportional to \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\pi(\\lambda | \\mathbf{x}) &amp;\\propto f(\\mathbf{x}|\\theta ) \\pi(\\lambda) \\\\ &amp;= C \\lambda^{\\sum_i x_i + \\alpha -1} \\exp(-\\lambda(n+1/\\theta)) \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(C\\) is a constant. We recognize this to be a gamma distribution with new parameters \\(\\alpha_{post} = \\sum_i x_i + \\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta_{post} = 1/(n + 1/\\theta)\\). Thus, the gamma distribution is a conjugate prior for the Poisson model distribution. Example 4.4.7. Actuarial Exam Question. You are given: The conditional distribution of the number of claims per policyholder is Poisson with mean \\(\\lambda\\). The variable \\(\\lambda\\) has a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\). For policyholders with 1 claim in Year 1, the Bayes prediction for the number of claims in Year 2 is 0.15. For policyholders with an average of 2 claims per year in Year 1 and Year 2, the Bayes prediction for the number of claims in Year 3 is 0.20. Calculate \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution. Since the conditional distribution of the number of claims per policyholder, \\(E(X|\\lambda)=Var(X|\\lambda)=\\lambda\\), the Bayes prediction is \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E}(X_2|X_1) &amp;= \\int \\mathrm{E}(X_2|\\lambda) \\pi(\\lambda|X_1) d\\lambda = \\alpha_{new} \\theta_{new} \\end{aligned} \\] because the posterior distribution is gamma with parameters \\(\\alpha_{new}\\) and \\(\\theta_{new}\\). For year 1, we have \\[ 0.15 = (X_1 + \\alpha) \\times \\frac{1}{n+1/\\theta} = (1 + \\alpha) \\times \\frac{1}{1+1/\\theta}, \\] so \\(0.15(1+1/\\theta)= 1 + \\alpha.\\) For year 2, we have \\[ 0.2 = (X_1+X_2 + \\alpha) \\times \\frac{1}{n+1/\\theta} = (4 + \\alpha) \\times \\frac{1}{2+1/\\theta}, \\] so \\(0.2(2+1/\\theta)= 4 + \\alpha.\\) Equating these yields \\[ 0.2(2+1/\\theta)=3 + 0.15(1+1/\\theta) \\] resulting in \\(\\theta = 1/55 = 0.018182\\). Closed-form expressions means that results can be readily interpreted and easily computed; hence, conjugate distributions are useful in actuarial practice. Two other special cases used extensively are: The uncertainty of parameters is summarized using a beta distribution and the outcomes have a (conditional on the parameter) binomial distribution. The uncertainty of parameters is summarized using a normal distribution and the outcomes are conditionally normally distributed. Additional results on conjugate distributions are summarized in the Appendix Section 16.3.

This chapter introduces probability models for describing the aggregate (total) claims that arise from a portfolio of insurance contracts. We present two standard modeling approaches, the individual risk model and the collective risk model. Further, we discuss strategies for computing the distribution of the aggregate claims, including exact methods for special cases, recursion, and simulation. Finally, we examine the effects of individual policy modifications such as deductibles, coinsurance, and inflation, on the frequency and severity distributions, and thus the aggregate loss distribution. 5.1 Introduction The objective of this chapter is to build a probability model to describe the aggregate claims by an insurance system occurring in a fixed time period. The insurance system could be a single policy, a group insurance contract, a business line, or an entire book of an insurer’s business. In this chapter, aggregate claimsThe sum of all claims observed in a period of time refer to either the number or the amount of claims from a portfolio of insurance contracts. However, the modeling framework can be readily applied in the more general setup. Consider an insurance portfolio of \\(n\\) individual contracts, and let \\(S\\) denote the aggregate losses of the portfolio in a given time period. There are two approaches to modeling the aggregate losses \\(S\\), the individual risk model and the collective risk model. The individual risk modelA modeling approach for aggregate losses in which the loss from each individual contract is considered. emphasizes the loss from each individual contract and represents the aggregate losses as: \\[\\begin{aligned} S_n=X_1 +X_2 +\\cdots+X_n, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(X_i~(i=1,\\ldots,n)\\) is interpreted as the loss amount from the \\(i\\)th contract. It is worth stressing that \\(n\\) denotes the number of contracts in the portfolio and thus is a fixed number rather than a random variable. For the individual risk model, one usually assumes \\(X_{i}\\)’s are independent. Because of different contract features such as coverageInsurance coverage is the amount of risk or liability that is covered for an individual or entity by an insurance policy. and exposureA measure of the rating units for which rates are applied to determine the premium. for example, exposures may be measured on a per unit basis (e.g. a family with auto insurance under one contract may have an exposure of 2 cars) or per $1,000 of value (e.g. homeowners insurance)., \\(X_{i}\\)’s are not necessarily identically distributed. A notable feature of the distribution of each \\(X_i\\) is the probability mass at zero corresponding to the event of no claims. The collective risk modelA modeling approach for aggregate losses in which the aggregate loss is represented in terms of a frequency distribution and a severity distribution. represents the aggregate losses in terms of a frequency distribution and a severity distribution: \\[\\begin{aligned} S_N=X_1 +X_2 +\\cdots+X_N. \\end{aligned}\\] Here, one thinks of a random number of claims \\(N\\) that may represent either the number of losses or the number of payments. In contrast, in the individual risk model, we use a fixed number of contracts \\(n\\). We think of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_N\\) as representing the amount of each loss. Each loss may or may not correspond to a unique contract. For instance, there may be multiple claims arising from a single contract. It is natural to think about \\(X_i&gt;0\\) because if \\(X_i=0\\) then no claim has occurred. Typically we assume that conditional on \\(N=n\\), \\(X_{1},X_{2},\\ldots ,X_{n}\\) are iidIndependent and identically distributed random variables. The distribution of \\(N\\) is known as the frequency distributionThe random number of claims that occur under the collective risk model., and the common distribution of \\(X\\) is known as the severity distributionThe randomly distributed amount of each loss under the collective risk model.. We further assume \\(N\\) and \\(X\\) are independent. With the collective risk model, we may decompose the aggregate losses into the frequency (\\(N\\)) process and the severity (\\(X\\)) model. This flexibility allows the analyst to comment on these two separate components. For example, sales growth due to lower underwriting standards could lead to higher frequency of losses but might not affect severity. Similarly, inflationInflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services over a period of time. or other economic forces could have an impact on severity but not on frequency. Show Quiz Solution 5.2 Individual Risk Model As noted earlier, for the individual risk model, we think of \\(X_i\\) as the loss from \\(i\\)th contract and interpret \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} S_n=X_1 +X_2 +\\cdots+X_n \\end{eqnarray*}\\] to be the aggregate loss from all contracts in a portfolio or group of contracts. Here, the \\(X_i\\)’s are not necessarily identically distributed and we have \\[\\begin{aligned} {\\rm E}(S_n) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\\rm E}(X_i)~. \\end{aligned}\\] Under the independence assumption on \\(X_i\\)’s (which implies \\(\\mathrm{Cov}\\left( X_i, X_j \\right) = 0\\) for all \\(i \\neq j\\)), it can further be shown that \\[\\begin{aligned} {\\rm Var}(S_n) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\\rm Var}(X_i) \\\\ P_{S_n}(z) &amp;= \\prod_{i=1}^{n}P_{X_i}(z) \\\\ M_{S_n}(t) &amp;= \\prod_{i=1}^{n}M_{X_i}(t), \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(P_{S_n}(\\cdot)\\) and \\(M_{S_n}(\\cdot)\\) are the probability generating function (pgf) and the moment generating function (mgf) of \\(S_n\\), respectively. The distribution of each \\(X_i\\) contains a probability mass at zero, corresponding to the event of no claims from the \\(i\\)th contract. One strategy to incorporate the zero mass in the distribution is to use the two-part framework: \\[\\begin{aligned} X_i = I_i\\times B_i = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 0~, &amp; \\text{if }~ I_i=0 \\\\ B_i~, &amp; \\text{if }~ I_i=1 \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned}\\] Here, \\(I_i\\) is a Bernoulli variable indicating whether or not a loss occurs for the \\(i\\)th contract, and \\(B_i\\) is a random variable with nonnegative supportThe set of all outcomes for a random variable following some distribution. for example, exponentially distributed random variable x has support x&gt;0. representing the amount of losses of the contract given loss occurrence. Assume that \\(I_1 ,\\ldots,I_n ,B_1 ,\\ldots,B_n\\) are mutually independent. Denote \\({\\rm Pr} (I_i =1)=q_i\\), \\(\\mu_i={\\rm E}(B_i)\\), and \\(\\sigma_i^2={\\rm Var}(B_i)\\). It can be shown (see Technical Supplement 5.A.1 for details) that \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E}(S_n)&amp; =\\sum_{i=1}^n ~q_i ~\\mu _i \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(S_n) &amp; =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( q_i \\sigma _i^2+q_i (1-q_i)\\mu_i^2 \\right)\\\\ P_{S_n}(z) &amp; =\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( 1-q_i+q_i P_{B_i}(z) \\right)\\\\ M_{S_n}(t) &amp; =\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( 1-q_i+q_i M_{B_i}(t) \\right) \\end{aligned}\\] A special case of the above model is when \\(B_i\\) follows a degenerate distribution with \\(\\mu_i=b_i\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_i=0\\). One example is term life insuranceA term life insurance policy is payable only if death of the insured occurs within a specified time, such as 5 or 10 years, or before a specified age. or a pure endowmentA pure endowment is an insurance policy that is payable at the end of the policy period if the insured is still alive. if the insured has died, there is nothing paid in the form of benefits. insurance where \\(b_i\\) represents the insurance benefit amount of the \\(i\\)th contract. Another strategy to accommodate the zero mass in the loss from each contract is to consider them in aggregate on the portfolio level, as in the collective risk model. Here, the aggregate loss is \\(S_{N} = X_1 + \\cdots X_N\\), where \\(N\\) is a random variable representing the number of non-zero claims that occurred out of the entire group of contracts. Thus, not every contract in the portfolio may be represented in this sum, and \\(S_N=0\\) when \\(N=0\\). The collective risk model will be discussed in detail in the next section. Example 5.2.1. Actuarial Exam Question. An insurance company sold 300 fire insurance policies as follows: \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{c c c} \\hline \\text{Number of} &amp; \\text{Policy} &amp; \\text{Probability of}\\\\ \\text{Policies} &amp; \\text{Maximum} &amp; \\text{Claim Per Policy}\\\\ &amp; (M_i) &amp; (q_i) \\\\ \\hline 100 &amp; 400 &amp; 0.05\\\\ 200 &amp; 300 &amp; 0.06\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] You are given: (i) The claim amount for each policy, \\(X_i\\), is uniformly distributed between \\(0\\) and the policy maximum \\(M_i\\). (ii) The probability of more than one claim per policy is \\(0\\). (iii) Claim occurrences are independent. Calculate the mean, \\(\\mathrm{E~}(S_{300})\\), and variance, \\(\\mathrm{Var~}(S_{300})\\), of the aggregate claims. How would these results change if every claim is equal to the policy maximum? Show Example Solution Solution. The aggregate claims are \\(S_{300} = X_1+\\cdots+X_{300}\\), where \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_{300}\\) are independent but not identically distributed. Policy claims amounts are uniformly distributed on \\((0,M_i)\\), so the mean claim amount is \\(M_i/2\\) and the variance is\\(M_i^2/12\\). Thus, for policy \\(i=1,\\ldots,300\\), we have \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\hline \\text{Number of} &amp; \\text{Policy} &amp; \\text{Probability of} &amp; \\text{Mean} &amp; \\text{Variance}\\\\ \\text{Policies} &amp; \\text{Maximum} &amp; \\text{Claim Per Policy} &amp; \\text{Amount} &amp; \\text{Amount}\\\\ &amp; (M_i) &amp; (q_{i}) &amp; (\\mu_{i}) &amp; (\\sigma_{i}^2) \\\\ \\hline 100 &amp; 400 &amp; 0.05 &amp; 200 &amp; 400^2/12\\\\ 200 &amp; 300 &amp; 0.06 &amp; 150 &amp; 300^2/12 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] The mean of the aggregate claims is \\[\\mathrm{E~} (S_{300}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{300} q_i \\mu_i = 100\\left\\{0.05(200)\\right\\} + 200\\left\\{0.06 (150) \\right\\} = 2,800\\] The variance of the aggregate claims is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{Var~}(S_{300}) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^{300} \\left( q_i \\sigma _i^2+q_i (1-q_i)\\mu_i^2 \\right) ~~~~ \\text{since } X_i \\text{&#39;s are independent} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 100\\left\\{ 0.05 \\left(\\frac{400^2}{12}\\right) +0.05 (1-0.05 )200^2 \\right\\}+ 200\\left\\{ 0.06 \\left(\\frac{300^2}{12}\\right) +0.06 (1-0.06 )150^2 \\right\\}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 600,467. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Follow-Up. Now suppose everybody receives the policy maximum \\(M_i\\) if a claim occurs. What is the expected aggregate loss \\(\\mathrm{E~}(\\tilde{S})\\) and variance of the aggregate loss \\(\\mathrm{Var~}(\\tilde{S})\\)? Each policy claim amount \\(X_i\\) is now deterministic and fixed at \\(M_i\\) instead of a randomly distributed amount, so \\(\\sigma_i^2 = \\mathrm{Var~} (X_i) = 0\\) and \\(\\mu_i = M_i\\). Again, the probability of a claim occurring for each policy is \\(q_i\\). Under these circumstances, the expected aggregate loss is \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E~}(\\tilde{S}) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{300} q_i \\mu_i = 100 \\left\\{0.05(400) \\right\\} + 200 \\left\\{ 0.06(300) \\right\\} = 5,600 \\end{aligned}\\] The variance of the aggregate loss is \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{Var~}(\\tilde{S}) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{300} \\left( q_i \\sigma _i^2+q_i (1-q_i )\\mu_i^2 \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{300} \\left( q_i (1-q_i) \\mu_i^2 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= 100 \\left\\{(0.05) (1-0.05) 400^2\\right\\} + 200 \\left\\{(0.06) (1-0.06)300^2\\right\\} \\\\ &amp;= 1,775,200 \\end{aligned}\\] The individual risk model can also be used for claim frequency. If \\(X_i\\) denotes the number of claims from the \\(i\\)th contract, then \\(S_n\\) is interpreted as the total number of claims from the portfolio. In this case, the above two-part framework still applies since there is a probability mass at zero for contracts that do not experience any claims. Assume \\(X_i\\) belongs to the \\((a,b,0)\\) class with pmfProbability mass function denoted by \\(p_{ik} = \\Pr(X_i=k)\\) for \\(k=0,1,\\ldots\\) (see Section 2.3). Let \\(X_i^{T}\\) denote the associated zero-truncated distribution in the \\((a,b,1)\\) class with pmf \\(p_{ik}^T=p_{ik}/(1-p_{i0})\\) for \\(k=1,2,\\ldots\\) (see Section 2.5.1). Using the relationship between their probability generating functions (see Technical Supplement 5.A.2 for details): \\[\\begin{aligned} P_{X_i}(z) = p_{i0} +(1-p_{i0}) P_{X_i^{T}}(z), \\end{aligned}\\] we can write \\(X_i=I_i\\times B_i\\) with \\(q_i={\\rm Pr}(I_i=1)={\\rm Pr}(X_i&gt;0)=1-p_{i0}\\) and \\(B_i=X_i^T\\). Notice that in this case, we have a zero-modified distribution since the \\(I_i\\) variable covers the modified probability mass at zero with \\(q_i = \\Pr(I_i=1)\\), while the \\(B_i=X_i^T\\) covers the discrete non-zero frequency portion. See Section 2.5.1 for the relationship between zero-truncated and zero-modified distributions. Example 5.2.2. An insurance company sold a portfolio of 100 independent homeowners insurance policies, each of which has claim frequency following a zero-modified Poisson distribution, as follows: \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{cccc} \\hline \\text{Type of} &amp; \\text{Number of} &amp; \\text{Probability of} &amp; \\lambda \\\\ \\text{Policy} &amp; \\text{Policies} &amp; \\text{At Least 1 Claim} &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\text{Low-risk} &amp; 40 &amp; 0.03 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\text{High-risk} &amp; 60 &amp; 0.05 &amp; 2 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Find the expected value and variance of the claim frequency for the entire portfolio. Show Example Solution Solution. For each policy, we can write the zero-modified Poisson claim frequency \\(N_i\\) as \\(N_i = I_i \\times B_i\\), where \\[q_i = \\Pr(I_i = 1) = \\Pr(N_i &gt; 0) = 1-p_{i0}\\] For the low-risk policies, we have \\(q_i = 0.03\\) and for the high-risk policies, we have \\(q_i=0.05\\). Further, \\(B_i = N_i^T\\), the zero-truncated version of \\(N_i\\). Thus, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mu_i &amp;={\\rm E}(B_i) = {\\rm E}(N_i^T) = \\frac{\\lambda}{1-e^{-\\lambda}} \\\\ \\sigma_i^2 &amp;={\\rm Var}(B_i) = {\\rm Var}(N_i^T) = \\frac{\\lambda [1-(\\lambda+1)e^{-\\lambda}]}{(1-e^{-\\lambda})^2} \\end{aligned}\\] Let the portfolio claim frequency be \\(S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n N_i\\). Using the formulas above, the expected claim frequency of the portfolio is \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E~} (S_n) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{100} q_i \\mu_i \\\\ &amp; = 40\\left[0.03 \\left(\\frac{1}{1-e^{-1}} \\right) \\right] + 60 \\left[0.05 \\left( \\frac{2}{1-e^{-2}} \\right) \\right] \\\\ &amp;= 40(0.03)(1.5820) + 60(0.05)(2.3130) = 8.8375 \\end{aligned}\\] The variance of the claim frequency of the portfolio is \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{Var~}(S_n) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( q_i \\sigma _i^2+q_i (1-q_i )\\mu_i^2 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= 40 \\left[ 0.03 \\left(\\frac{1-2e^{-1}}{(1-e^{-1})^2} \\right) + 0.03(0.97)(1.5820^2) \\right] + 60 \\left[0.05 \\left( \\frac{2[1-3e^{-2}]}{ (1-e^{-2})^2} \\right) + 0.05(0.95)(2.3130^2) \\right] \\\\ &amp;= 23.7214 \\end{aligned}\\] Note that equivalently, we could have calculated the mean and variance of an individual policy directly using the relationship between the zero-modified and zero-truncated Poisson distributions (see Section 2.3). To understand the distribution of the aggregate loss, one could use the central limit theoremGiven certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a large number of replications of independent random variables, each with a finite mean and variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution. to approximate the distribution of \\(S_n\\) for large \\(n\\). Denote \\(\\mu_{S_n}={\\rm E}(S_n)\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{S_n}={\\rm Var}(S_n)\\) and let \\(Z\\sim N(0,1)\\), a standard normal random variable with cdfCumulative distribution function \\(\\Phi\\). Then the cdf of \\(S_n\\) can be approximated as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} F_{S_n}(s) &amp;= {\\rm Pr}({S_n}\\leq s) = \\Pr \\left( \\frac{S_n - \\mu_{S_n}}{\\sigma_{S_n}} \\leq \\frac{s-\\mu_{S_n}}{\\sigma_{S_n}} \\right) \\\\ &amp;\\approx \\Pr\\left( Z \\leq \\frac{s-\\mu_{S_n}}{\\sigma_{S_n}} \\right) = \\Phi \\left(\\frac{s-\\mu_S}{\\sigma_S}\\right). \\end{aligned}\\] Example 5.2.3. Actuarial Exam Question - Follow-Up. As in the Example 5.2.1 earlier, an insurance company sold 300 fire insurance policies, with claim amounts \\(X_i\\) uniformly distributed between 0 and the policy maximum \\(M_i\\). Using the normal approximation, calculate the probability that the aggregate claim amount \\(S_{300}\\) exceeds \\(\\$3,500\\). Show Example Solution Solution. We have seen earlier that \\(\\mathrm{E}(S_{300})=2,800\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(S_{300}) = 600,467\\). Then \\[\\begin{aligned} {\\rm Pr}(S_{300} &gt; 3,500) &amp;= 1 - {\\rm Pr}(S_{300} \\leq 3,500) \\\\ &amp;\\approx 1- \\Phi \\left( \\frac{3,500-2,800}{\\sqrt{600,467}} \\right) = 1 - \\Phi \\left( 0.90334 \\right) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - 0.8168 = 0.1832 \\end{aligned}\\] For small \\(n\\), the distribution of \\(S_n\\) is likely skewed, and the normal approximation would be a poor choice. To examine the aggregate loss distribution, we go back to the basics and first principles. Specifically, the distribution can be derived recursively. Define \\(S_k=X_1 + \\cdots + X_k, k=1,\\ldots,n\\). For \\(k=1\\): \\[F_{S_1}(s) = {\\rm Pr}(S_1\\leq s) = {\\rm Pr}(X_1\\leq s) = F_{X_1}(s).\\] For \\(k=2,\\ldots,n\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} F_{S_k}(s)&amp;={\\Pr}(X_1+\\cdots+X_k\\leq s) ={\\Pr}(S_{k-1}+X_k\\leq s) \\\\ &amp;={\\rm E}_{X_k}\\left[{\\rm Pr}(S_{k-1}\\leq s-X_k|X_k)\\right]= {\\rm E}_{X_k}\\left[F_{S_{k-1}}(s-X_k)\\right]. \\end{aligned}\\] A special case is when \\(X_i\\)’s are identically distributed. Let \\(F_X(x)={\\Pr}(X\\leq x)\\) be the common distribution of \\(X_i, ~i=1,\\ldots,n\\). We define \\[F^{*n}_X(x)={\\Pr}(X_1+\\cdots+X_n\\leq x)\\] the \\(n\\)-fold convolutionThe convolution of probability distributions is the distribution corresponding to the addition of independent random variables. of \\(F_X\\). More generally, we can compute \\(F_X^{\\ast n}\\) recursively. Begin the recursion at \\(k=1\\) using \\(F_X^{\\ast 1} \\left(x \\right) =F_X(x)\\). Next, for \\(k=2\\), we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} F_X^{\\ast 2} \\left(x \\right) &amp;=&amp; \\Pr(X_1 + X_2 \\le x) = \\mathrm{E}_{X_2} \\left[ \\Pr(X_1 \\le x - X_2|X_2) \\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{E}_{X_2} \\left[ F(x - X_2) \\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \\int_{0}^{x} F(x-y) f(y) dy &amp; \\text{for continuous } X_i \\text{&#39;s} \\\\ \\sum_{y \\le x} F(x-y) f(y) &amp; \\text{for discrete } X_i \\text{&#39;s} \\\\ \\end{array}\\right. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Recall \\(F(0) = 0\\). Similarly for \\(k=n\\), we have \\(S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n\\) and \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} F^{\\ast n}\\left(x\\right) &amp;=&amp; \\Pr(S_n \\le x) = \\Pr(S_{n-1} + X_n \\le x)\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{E}_{X_n} \\left[ \\Pr(S_{n-1} \\le x - X_n|X_n) \\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{E}_X \\left[ F^{\\ast(n-1)}(x - X) \\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \\int_{0}^{x} F^{\\ast(n-1)}(x-y)f(y)dy &amp; \\text{for continuous } X_i \\text{&#39;s} \\\\ \\sum_{y \\le x} F^{\\ast(n-1)}(x-y)f(y) &amp; \\text{for discrete } X_i \\text{&#39;s} \\\\ \\end{array}\\right. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] When \\(X_i\\)’s are independent and belong to the same family of distributions, there are some simple cases where \\(S_n\\) has a closed form. This makes it easy to compute \\(\\Pr(S_n \\le x)\\). This property is known as closed under convolution, meaning the distribution of the sum of independent random variables belongs to the same family of distributions as that of the component variables, just with different parameters. Examples include: \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table of Closed Form Partial Sum Distributions}\\\\ \\begin{array}{l|l|l} \\hline \\text{Distribution of } X_i &amp; \\text{Abbreviation} &amp; \\text{Distribution of } S_n \\\\ \\hline \\text{Normal with mean } \\mu_i \\text{ and variance } \\sigma_i^2 &amp; N(\\mu_i,\\sigma_i^2) &amp; N\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mu_i,~\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma_i^2\\right) \\\\ \\text{Exponential with mean } \\theta &amp; Exp(\\theta) &amp; Gam(n,\\theta)\\\\ \\text{Gamma with shape } \\alpha_i \\text{ and scale } \\theta &amp; Gam(\\alpha_i,\\theta) &amp; Gam\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\alpha_i,\\theta\\right) \\\\ \\text{Poisson with mean (and variance) } \\lambda_i &amp; Poi(\\lambda_i)&amp; Poi\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\lambda_i\\right)\\\\ \\text{Binomial with } m_i \\text{ trials and } q \\text{ success probability} &amp; Bin(m_i, q)&amp; Bin\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i, q\\right)\\\\ \\text{Geometric with mean } \\beta &amp; Geo(\\beta) &amp; NB(\\beta,n)\\\\ \\text{Negative binomial with mean } r_i \\beta~ \\text{ and variance } ~r_i \\beta (1+\\beta) &amp; NB(\\beta,r_i)&amp; NB\\left(\\beta,\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i\\right)\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Example 5.2.4.

Let \\(X_i \\sim Geo(\\beta=1.5)\\) be the number of doctor visits for one individual in the family and \\(S_4 = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4\\) be the number of doctor visits for the family.

This section provides some simple examples. Although these examples are computationally convenient, they are generally too simple to be used in practice. Example 5.3.8. One has a closed-form expression for the aggregate loss distribution by assuming a geometric frequency distribution and an exponential severity distribution. Assume that claim count \\(N\\) is geometric with mean \\(\\mathrm{E}(N)=\\beta\\), and that claim amount \\(X\\) is exponential with \\(\\mathrm{E}(X)=\\theta\\). Recall that the pgf of \\(N\\) and the mgf of \\(X\\) are: \\[\\begin{aligned} P_N (z) &amp;=\\frac{1}{1- \\beta (z-1)}\\\\ M_{X}(t) &amp;=\\frac{1}{1-\\theta t} \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, the mgf of aggregate loss \\(S_N\\) can be expressed two ways (for details, see Technical Supplement 5.A.3) \\[\\begin{eqnarray} M_{S_N}(t) &amp;=&amp; P_N [M_{X}(t)] = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta \\left( \\frac{1}{1-\\theta t} - 1\\right)} \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1+ \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\left([1-\\theta(1+\\beta)t]^{-1}-1 \\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{1+\\beta}(1) +\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-\\theta (1+\\beta)t}\\right) \\end{eqnarray}\\] From (5.1), we note that \\(S_N\\) is equivalent to the compound distribution of \\(S_N=X^{*}_1+\\cdots+X^{*}_{N^{*}}\\), where \\(N^{*}\\) is a Bernoulli with mean \\(\\beta/(1+\\beta)\\) and \\(X^{*}\\) is an exponential with mean \\(\\theta(1+\\beta)\\). To see this, we examine the mgf of \\(S\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} M_{S_N}(t) = P_N [M_{X}(t)] = P_{N^{*}} [M_{X^{*}}(t)], \\end{aligned}\\] where \\[\\begin{aligned} P_{N^*} (z) &amp;=1+ \\frac{\\beta}{1+ \\beta} (z-1),\\\\ M_{X^*} (t) &amp;=\\frac{1}{1- {{\\theta(1+\\beta)}} t}. \\end{aligned}\\] From (5.2), we note that \\(S_N\\) is also equivalent to a 2-point mixture of 0 and \\(X^{*}\\). Specifically, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} S_N &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cl} 0 &amp; {\\rm with~ probability ~Pr}(N^*=0) = 1/(1+\\beta) \\\\ Y^{*} &amp; {\\rm with~ probability ~Pr}(N^*=1) = \\beta/(1+\\beta) \\end{array} \\right.. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The distribution function of \\(S_N\\) is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\Pr(S_N=0) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{1+\\beta}\\\\ \\Pr(S_N&gt;s) &amp;=&amp; \\Pr(X^*&gt;s) =\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{s}{ \\theta (1+\\beta)}\\right) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] with pdfProbability density function \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} f_{S_N}(s) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\theta (1+\\beta)^2}\\exp\\left( -\\frac{s}{ \\theta (1+\\beta)}\\right). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Example 5.3.9. Consider a collective risk model with an exponential severity and an arbitrary frequency distribution. Recall that if \\(X_i\\sim Exp(\\theta)\\), then the sum of iid exponential, \\(S_n=X_1+\\cdots+X_n\\), has a gamma distribution, i.e. \\(S_n\\sim Gam(n,\\theta)\\). This has cdf: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} F_{X}^{\\ast n}(s) &amp;=&amp; \\Pr (S_n \\le s) = \\int_{0}^{s} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(n)\\theta^n}s^{n-1}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{\\theta}\\right) ds\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1-\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{j!}\\left( \\frac{s}{\\theta}\\right)^j e^{-s/\\theta } . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The last equality is derived by applying integration by parts \\(n-1\\) times. For the aggregate loss distribution, we can interchange the order of summations in the second line below to get \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} F_{S}\\left(s\\right) &amp;=&amp; p_{0}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }p_n F_{X}^{\\ast n}\\left(s\\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1 - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }p_n \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{j!} \\left( \\frac{s}{\\theta}\\right)^j e^{-s/\\theta }\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1-e^{-s/\\theta}\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j!} \\left( \\frac{s}{\\theta} \\right)^j \\overline{P}_j \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\overline{P}_j =p_{j+1}+p_{j+2}+\\cdots = \\Pr (N&gt;j)\\) is the ``survival function’’ of the claims count distribution. 5.3.4 Tweedie Distribution In this section, we examine a particular compound distribution where the number of claims has a Poisson distribution and the amount of claims has a gamma distribution. This specification leads to what is known as a Tweedie distributionA compound distribution that is a poisson sum of gamma random variables. because it can accommodate a discrete probability mass at zero and a continuous positive component, it is suitable for modeling aggregate insurance claims.. The Tweedie distribution has a mass probability at zero and a continuous component for positive values. Because of this feature, it is widely used in insurance claims modeling, where the zero mass is interpreted as no claims and the positive component as the amount of claims. Specifically, consider the collective risk model \\(S_N=X_1+\\cdots+X_N\\). Suppose that \\(N\\) has a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\lambda\\), and each \\(X_i\\) has a gamma distribution shape parameterA numerical parameter of a parametric distribution affecting the shape of a distribution rather than simply shifting it (as a location parameter does) or stretching/shrinking it (as a scale parameter does). \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameterA numerical parameter of a parametric distribution that stretches/shrinks the distribution without changing its location or shape. the larger the scale parameter, the more spread out the distribution. the scale parameter is also the reciprocal of the rate parameter. for example, the normal distribution has scale parameter . \\(\\gamma\\). The Tweedie distribution is derived as the Poisson sum of gamma variables. To understand the distribution of \\(S_N\\), we first examine the mass probability at zero. The aggregate loss is zero when no claims occurred, i.e. \\[{\\rm Pr}(S_N=0)= {\\rm Pr}(N=0)=e^{-\\lambda}.\\] In addition, note that \\(S_N\\) conditional on \\(N=n\\), denoted by \\(S_n=X_1+\\cdots+X_n\\), follows a gamma distribution with shape \\(n\\alpha\\) and scale \\(\\gamma\\). Thus, for \\(s&gt;0\\), the density of a Tweedie distribution can be calculated as \\[\\begin{aligned} f_{S_n}(s)&amp;=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} p_n f_{S_n}(s)\\\\ &amp;=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}e^{-\\lambda}\\frac{(\\lambda)^n}{n!}\\frac{\\gamma^{na}}{\\Gamma(n\\alpha)}s^{n\\alpha-1}e^{-s\\gamma} \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, the Tweedie distribution can be thought of a mixture of zero and a positive valued distribution, which makes it a convenient tool for modeling insurance claims and for calculating pure premiums. The mean and variance of the Tweedie compound Poisson model are: \\[{\\rm E} (S_N)=\\lambda\\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma}~~~~{\\rm and}~~~~{\\rm Var} (S)=\\lambda\\frac{\\alpha(1+\\alpha)}{\\gamma^2}.\\] As another important feature, the Tweedie distribution is a special case of exponential dispersionA set of distributions that represents a generalisation of the natural exponential family and also plays an important role in generalized linear models. models, a class of models used to describe the random component in generalized linear modelsCommonly known by the acronym glm. an extension of the linear regression model where the dependent variable is a member of the linear exponential family. glm encompasses linear, binary, count, and long-tailed, regressions all as special cases.. To see this, we consider the following reparameterization: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\lambda=\\frac{\\mu^{2-p}}{\\phi(2-p)},~~~~\\alpha=\\frac{2-p}{p-1},~~~~\\frac{1}{\\gamma}=\\phi(p-1)\\mu^{p-1} \\end{equation*}\\] With the above relationships, one can show that the distribution of \\(S_N\\) is \\[f_{S_N}(s)=\\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{\\phi}\\left(\\frac{-s}{(p-1)\\mu^{p-1}}-\\frac{\\mu^{2-p}}{2-p}\\right)+C(s;\\phi)\\right]\\] where \\[\\begin{equation*} C(s;\\phi/\\omega_i)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \\displaystyle 0 &amp; {\\rm if}~ y=0 \\\\ \\displaystyle \\ln \\sum\\limits_{n\\ge 1} \\left\\{\\frac{(1/\\phi)^{1/(p-1)}y^{(2-p)/(p-1)}}{(2-p)(p-1)^{(2-p)/(p-1)}}\\right\\}^{n}\\frac{1}{n!\\Gamma(n(2-p)/(p-1))s} &amp; {\\rm if}~ y&gt;0 \\end{array}\\right. \\end{equation*}\\] Hence, the distribution of \\(S_N\\) belongs to the exponential familyA family of parametric distributions that are practical for modeling the underlying response variable in generalized linear models. this family includes the normal, bernoulli, poisson, and tweedie distributions as special cases, among many others. with parameters \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\phi\\), and \\(1 &lt; p &lt; 2\\), and we have \\[{\\rm E} (S_N)=\\mu~~~~{\\rm and}~~~~{\\rm Var} (S_N)=\\phi\\mu^{p}.\\] This allows us to use the Tweedie distribution with generalized linear models to model claims. It is also worth mentioning the two limiting cases of the Tweedie model: \\(p\\rightarrow 1\\) results in the Poisson distribution and \\(p\\rightarrow 2\\) results in the gamma distribution. Thus, the Tweedie model accommodates the situations in between the gamma and Poisson distributions, which makes intuitive sense as it is the Poisson sum of gamma random variables. Show Quiz Solution 5.4 Computing the Aggregate Claims Distribution Computing the distribution of aggregate losses is a difficult, yet important, problem. As we have seen, for both individual risk model and collective risk model, computing the distribution frequently involves the evaluation of a \\(n\\)-fold convolution. To make the problem tractable, one strategy is to use a distribution that is easy to evaluate to approximate the aggregate loss distribution. For instance, normal distribution is a natural choice based on central limit theorem where parameters of the normal distribution can be estimated by matching the moments. This approach has its strength and limitations. The main advantage is the ease of computation. The disadvantage are: first, the size and direction of approximation error are unknown; second, the approximation may fail to capture some special features of the aggregate loss such as mass point at zero. This section discusses two practical approaches to computing the distribution of aggregate loss, the recursive method and the simulation. 5.4.1 Recursive Method The recursive method applies to compound models where the frequency component \\(N\\) belongs to either \\((a,b,0)\\) or \\((a,b,1)\\) class (see Sections 2.3 and 2.5.1) and the severity component \\(X\\) has a discrete distribution. For continuous \\(X\\), a common practice is to first discretize the severity distribution, after which the recursive method is ready to apply. Assume that \\(N\\) is in the \\((a,b,1)\\) class so that \\(p_{k}=\\left( a+\\frac{b}{k} \\right) p_{k-1}, k = 2,3,\\ldots\\). Further assume that the support of \\(X\\) is \\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,m\\}\\), discrete and finite. Then, the probability function of \\(S_N\\) is: \\[\\begin{aligned} f_{S_N}(s)&amp;=\\Pr (S=s) \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{1-af_{X}(0)}\\left\\{ \\left[ p_1 -(a+b)p_{0}\\right] f_X (s)+\\sum_{x=1}^{s\\wedge m}\\left( a+\\frac{bx}{s} \\right) f_X (x)f_{S_N}(s-x)\\right\\}. \\end{aligned}\\] If \\(N\\) is in the \\((a,b,0)\\) class, then \\(p_1=(a+b)p_0\\) and so \\[ f_{S_N}(s)=\\frac{1}{1-af_X (0)}\\left\\{ \\sum_{x=1}^{s\\wedge m}\\left( a+\\frac{bx }{s}\\right) f_X (x)f_{S_N}(s-x)\\right\\}. \\] Special Case: Poisson Frequency. If \\(N \\sim Poi(\\lambda)\\), then \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=\\lambda\\), and thus \\[ f_{S_N}(s)=\\frac{\\lambda }{s}\\left\\{ \\sum_{x=1}^{s \\wedge m} x f_X (x) f_{S_N} (s-x)\\right\\} . \\] Example 5.4.1. Actuarial Exam Question. The number of claims in a period \\(N\\) has a geometric distribution with mean 4. The amount of each claim \\(X\\) follows \\({\\rm Pr} (X = x) = 0.25\\), for \\(x = 1,2,3,4\\). The number of claims and the claim amount are independent. \\(S_N\\) is the aggregate claim amount in the period. Calculate \\(F_{S_N}(3)\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The severity distribution \\(X\\) follows \\[f_X (x) = \\frac{1}{4}, \\ \\ x=1, 2, 3, 4.\\] The frequency distribution \\(N\\) is geometric with mean 4, which is a member of the \\((a,b,0)\\) class with \\(b=0\\), \\(a=\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} = \\frac{4}{5}\\), and \\(p_0 = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta} = \\frac{1}{5}\\). The support of severity component \\(X\\) is \\(\\{1,\\ldots,m=4 \\}\\), discrete and finite. Thus, we can use the recursive method \\[\\begin{aligned} f_{S_N} (x) &amp;= 1 \\sum_{y=1}^{x\\wedge m} (a+0) f_X (y) f_{S_N} (x-y) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{4}{5} \\sum_{y=1}^{x\\wedge m} f_X (y) f_{S_N} (x-y) \\end{aligned}\\] Specifically, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} f_{S_N} (0) &amp;= \\Pr(N=0) = p_0=\\frac{1}{5}\\\\ f_{S_N} (1) &amp;= \\frac{4}{5}\\sum_{y=1}^{1} f_X (y) f_{S_N} (1-y) = \\frac{4}{5} f_X(1) f_{S_N}(0)\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{4}{5}\\left( \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\right) = \\frac{1}{25}\\\\ f_{S_N} (2) &amp;= \\frac{4}{5}\\sum_{y=1}^{2} f_X (y) f_{S_N} (2-y) = \\frac{4}{5} \\left[ f_X(1)f_{S_N}(1) + f_X(2) f_{S_N}(0) \\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{4}{5}\\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{4}{5}\\left( \\frac{6}{100}\\right) = \\frac{6}{125}\\\\ f_{S_N} (3) &amp;= \\frac{4}{5} \\left[ f_X(1) f_{S_N}(2) + f_X(2)f_{S_N}(1) + f_X(3) f_{S_N}(0) \\right]\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{4}{5}\\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{6}{125}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{5}\\left( \\frac{5+25+6}{125}\\right) = 0.0576\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ F_{S_N} (3) &amp;= f_{S_N} (0)+f_{S_N} (1)+f_{S_N} (2) +f_{S_N} (3) = 0.3456 \\end{aligned}\\] 5.4.2 Simulation The distribution of aggregate loss can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulationA computerized statistical model that simulates the effects of various types of uncertainty.. The idea is that one can calculate the empirical distribution of \\(S_N\\) using a random sample. The expected value and variance of the aggregate loss can also be estimated using the sample mean and sample variance of the simulated values. Below we summarize the simulation procedures for the aggregate loss models. Let \\(m\\) be the size of the generated random sample of aggregate losses. Individual Risk Model \\(S_n=X_1+\\cdots+X_n\\) Let \\(j=1,\\ldots,m\\) be a counter. Start by setting \\(j=1\\). Generate each individual loss realization \\(x_{ij}\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\). For example, this can be done using the inverse transformation method (Section 6.2). Calculate the aggregate loss \\(s_j = x_{1j} + \\cdots + x_{nj}\\). Repeat the above two steps for \\(j=2,\\ldots,m\\) to obtain a size-\\(m\\) sample of \\(S_n\\), i.e. \\(\\{s_1,\\ldots,s_m\\}\\). Collective Risk Model \\(S_N=X_1+\\cdots+X_N\\) Let \\(j=1, \\ldots, m\\) be a counter. Start by setting \\(j=1\\). Generate the number of claims \\(n_j\\) from the frequency distribution \\(N\\). Given \\(n_j\\), generate the amount of each claim independently from severity distribution \\(X\\), denoted by \\(x_{1j},\\ldots,x_{n_j j}\\). Calculate the aggregate loss \\(s_j = x_{1j} + \\cdots + x_{n_j j}\\). Repeat the above three steps for \\(j=2,\\ldots,m\\) to obtain a size-\\(m\\) sample of \\(S_N\\), i.e. \\(\\{s_1,\\ldots, s_m\\}\\). Given the random sample of \\(S\\), the empirical distribution can be calculated as \\[\\hat{F}_S(s)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}I(s_i\\leq s),\\] where \\(I(\\cdot)\\) is an indicator function. The empirical distributionThe empirical distribution is a non-parametric estimate of the underlying distribution of a random variable. it directly uses the data observations to construct the distribution, with each observed data point in a size-n sample having probability 1/n. \\(\\hat{F}_S(s)\\) will convergeA type of stochastic convergence for a sequence of random variables x_1,…, x_n that approaches some other distribution as n approaches . to \\({F}_S(s)\\) almost surely as the sample size \\(m\\rightarrow \\infty\\). The above procedure assumes that the probability distributions, including the parameter values, of the frequency and severity distributions are known. In practice, one would need to first assume these distributions, estimate their parameters from the data, and then assess the quality of model fit using various model validation tools (see Chapter 4). For instance, the assumptions in the collective risk model suggest a two-stage estimation where one model is developed for the number of claims \\(N\\) from the data on claim counts, and another model is developed for the severity of claims \\(X\\) from the data on the amount of claims. Example 5.4.2. Recall Example 5.3.5 with an individual’s claim frequency \\(N \\sim Poi(\\lambda=25)\\) and claim severity \\(X \\sim U(5,95)\\). Using a simulated sample of 10000 observations, estimate the mean and variance of the aggregate loss \\(S_N\\). In addition, use the simulated sample to estimate the probability that aggregate claims for this individual will exceed 2000 and compare with the normal approximation estimates from Example 5.3.5. Show Example Solution Solution. We follow the algorithm for the collective risk model, where we first simulate frequencies \\(n_1,\\ldots,n_{10000}\\), and conditional on \\(n_j,~j=1,\\ldots,10000\\), simulate each individual loss \\(x_{ij},~i=1,\\ldots n_j\\). set.seed(4321) # For reproducibility of results m &lt;- 10000 # Number of observations to simulate lambda &lt;- 25 # Parameter for frequency distribution N a &lt;- 5; b &lt;- 95 # Parameters for severity distribution X S &lt;- rep(NA, m) # Initalize an empty vector to store S observations n &lt;- rpois(m, lambda) # Generate m=10000 observations of N from Poisson for(j in 1:m){ n_j &lt;- n[j] # Given each n_j (j=1,...,m), generate n_j observations of X from uniform x_j &lt;- runif(n_j, min=a, max=b) s_j &lt;- sum(x_j) # Calculate the aggregate loss s_j S[j] &lt;- s_j # Store s_j in the vector of observations } mean(S) # Compare to theoretical value of 1,250 ## [1] 1248.09 var(S) # Compare to theoretical value of 79,375 ## [1] 77441.22 mean(S&gt;2000) # Proportion of simulated observations s_j that are &gt; 2000 ## [1] 0.0062 # Compare to normal approximation method of 0.003884 Using simulation, we estimate the mean and variance of the aggregate claims to be approximately 1248 and 77441 respectively, compared to the theoretical values of 1,250 and 79,375. In addition, we estimate the probability that aggregate losses exceed 2000 to be 0.0062, compared to the normal approximation estimate of 0.003884. We can assess the appropriateness of the normal approximation by comparing the empirical distribution of the simulated aggregate losses to the density of the normal distribution used for the normal approximation, \\(N(\\mu=1,250~, ~\\sigma^2=79,375)\\): The simulated losses are slightly more right-skewed than the normal distribution, with a longer right tail. This explains why the normal approximation estimate of \\(\\Pr(S_N &gt; 2000)\\) is lower than the simulated estimate. Show Quiz Solution 5.5 Effects of Coverage Modifications 5.5.1 Impact of Exposure on Frequency This section focuses on an individual risk model for claim counts. Recall the individual risk model involves a fixed \\(n\\) number of contracts and independent loss random variables \\(X_i\\). Consider the number of claims from a group of \\(n\\) policies: \\[S=X_1+\\cdots+X_n\\] where we assume \\(X_i\\) are iid representing the number of claims from policy \\(i\\). In this case, the exposure for the portfolio is \\(n\\), using policy as exposure base. The pgf of \\(S\\) is \\[\\begin{aligned} P_{S}(z)&amp;={\\rm E}(z^S)={\\rm E}\\left(z^{\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}\\right)\\\\ &amp;=\\prod_{i=1}^n{\\rm E}(z^{X_i})=[P_X(z)]^n \\end{aligned}\\] Special Case: Poisson. If \\(X_i\\sim Poi(\\lambda)\\), its pgf is \\(P_X(z)=e^{\\lambda(z-1)}\\). Then the pgf of \\(S\\) is \\[P_{S}(z)=[e^{\\lambda(z-1)}]^n=e^{n\\lambda(z-1)}.\\] So \\(S\\sim Poi(n\\lambda)\\). That is, the sum of \\(n\\) independent Poisson random variables each with mean \\(\\lambda\\) has a Poisson distribution with mean \\(n\\lambda\\). Special Case: Negative Binomial. If \\(X_i\\sim NB(\\beta,r)\\), its pgf is \\(P_X(z)=[1-\\beta(z-1)]^{-r}\\). Then the pgf of \\(S\\) is \\[P_{S}(z)=[[1-\\beta(z-1)]^{-r}]^n=[1-\\beta(z-1)]^{-nr}.\\] So \\(S\\sim NB(\\beta,nr)\\). Example 5.5.1. Assume that the number of claims for each vehicle is Poisson with mean \\(\\lambda\\). Given the following data on the observed number of claims for each household, calculate the MLEMaximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\lambda\\). \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{c|c|c} \\hline \\text{Household ID} &amp; \\text{Number of vehicles} &amp; \\text{Number of claims} \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\\\ 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Show Example Solution Solution. Each of the 5 households has number of exposures \\(n_j\\) (number of vehicles) and number of claims \\(S_j\\), \\(j=1,...,5\\). Note for each household, the number of claims \\(S_j \\sim Poi (n_j \\lambda)\\). The likelihood function is \\[\\begin{aligned} L(\\lambda) &amp;= \\prod_{j=1}^5 \\Pr(S_j=s_j) = \\prod_{j=1}^5 \\frac{e^{-n_j\\lambda} (n_j \\lambda)^{s_j}}{s_j!} \\\\ &amp;= \\left(\\frac{e^{-2\\lambda} (2 \\lambda)^{0}}{0!} \\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{-1\\lambda} (1 \\lambda)^{2}}{2!} \\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{-3\\lambda} (3 \\lambda)^{2}}{2!} \\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{-1\\lambda} (1 \\lambda)^{0}}{0!} \\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{-1\\lambda} (1 \\lambda)^{1}}{1!} \\right) \\\\ &amp;\\propto e^{-8\\lambda} \\lambda^5 \\end{aligned}\\] Taking the log-likehood, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} l(\\lambda) = \\log L(\\lambda) = -8\\lambda + 5\\log(\\lambda) \\end{aligned}\\] Setting the first derivative of the log-likehood to 0, we get \\(\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{5}{8}\\) If the exposure of the portfolio changes from \\(n_1\\) to \\(n_2\\), we can establish the following relation between the aggregate claim counts: \\[P_{S_{n_2}}(z)=[P_X(z)]^{n_2}=[P_X(z)^{n_1}]^{n_2/n_1}=P_{S_{n_1}}(z)^{n_2/n_1}.\\] 5.5.2 Impact of Deductibles on Claim Frequency This section examines the effect of deductibles on claim frequency. Intuitively, there will be fewer claims filed when a policy deductible is imposed because a loss below the deductible level may not result in a claim. Even if an insured does file a claim, this may not result in a payment by the policy, since the claim may be denied or the loss amount may ultimately be determined to be below deductible. Let \\(N^L\\) denote the number of losses (i.e. the number of claims with no deductible), and \\(N^P\\) denote the number of payments when a deductible \\(d\\) is imposed. Our goal is to identify the distribution of \\(N^P\\) given the distribution of \\(N^L\\). We show below that the relationship between \\(N^L\\) and \\(N^P\\) can be established within an aggregate risk model framework. Note that sometimes changes in deductibles will affect policyholder claim behavior. We assume that this is not the case, i.e. the underlying distributions of losses for both frequency and severity remain unchanged when the deductible changes. Given there are \\(N^L\\) losses, let \\(X_1,X_2\\ldots,X_{N^L}\\) be the associated amount of losses. For \\(j=1,\\ldots,N^L\\), define \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} I_j&amp;=&amp; \\left \\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; \\text{if} ~X_j&gt;d\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right.. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Then we establish \\[N^P=I_1+I_2+\\cdots+I_{N_L},\\] that is, the total number of payments is equal to the number of losses above the deductible level. Given that \\(I_j\\)’s are independent Bernoulli random variables with probability of success \\(v=\\Pr(X&gt;d)\\), the sum of a fixed number of such variables is then a binomial random variable. Thus, conditioning on \\(N^L\\), \\(N^P\\) has a binomial distribution, i.e. \\(N^P | N^L \\sim Bin(N^L, v)\\), where \\(v=\\Pr(X&gt;d)\\). This implies that \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E}\\left(z^{N^P}|N^L\\right)&amp;= \\left[ 1+v(z-1)\\right]^{N^L} \\end{aligned}\\] So the pgf of \\(N^P\\) is \\[\\begin{aligned} P_{N^P}(z)&amp;= \\mathrm{E}_{N^P}\\left(z^{N^P}\\right)=\\mathrm{E}_{N^L}\\left[\\mathrm{E}_{N^P}\\left(z^{N^P}|N^L\\right)\\right]\\\\ &amp;= \\mathrm{E}_{N^L}\\left[(1+v(z-1))^{N^L}\\right]\\\\ &amp;= P_{N^L}\\left(1+v(z-1)\\right) \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, we can write the pgf of \\(N^P\\) as the pgf of \\(N^L\\), evaluated at a new argument \\(z^* = 1+v(z-1)\\). That is, \\(P_{N^P}(z)=P_{N^L}(z^*)\\). Special Cases: \\(N^L\\sim Poi (\\lambda)\\). The pgf of \\(N^L\\) is \\(P_{N^L}=e^{\\lambda(z-1)}\\). Thus the pgf of \\(N^P\\) is \\[\\begin{aligned} P_{N^P}(z) &amp;= e^{ \\lambda(1+v(z-1)-1)} \\\\ &amp;= e^{\\lambda v(z-1)} , \\end{aligned}\\] So \\(N^P \\sim Poi(\\lambda v)\\). This means the number of payments has the same distribution as the number of losses, but with the expected number of payments equal to \\(\\lambda v = \\lambda \\Pr(X&gt;d)\\). \\(N^L \\sim NB(\\beta, r)\\). The pgf of \\(N^L\\) is \\(P_{N^{L}}\\left( z\\right) =\\left[ 1-\\beta \\left( z-1\\right)\\right]^{-r}\\). Thus the pgf of \\(N^P\\) is \\[\\begin{aligned} P_{N^P}(z)&amp;= \\left( 1-\\beta (1+v(z-1)-1)\\right)^{-r}\\\\ &amp;= \\left( 1-\\beta v(z-1)\\right)^{-r}, \\end{aligned}\\] So \\(N^P \\sim NB(\\beta v, r)\\). This means the number of payments has the same distribution as the number of losses, but with parameters \\(\\beta v\\) and \\(r\\). Example 5.5.2. Suppose that loss amounts \\(X_i\\sim Pareto(\\alpha=4,\\ \\theta=150)\\). You are given that the loss frequency is \\(N^L\\sim Poi(\\lambda)\\) and the payment frequency distribution is \\(N^{P}_1\\sim Poi(0.4)\\) at deductible level \\(d_1=30\\). Find the distribution of the payment frequency \\(N^{P}_2\\) when the deductible level is \\(d_2=100\\). Show Example Solution Solution. Because the loss frequency \\(N^L\\) is Poisson, we can relate the means of the loss distribution \\(N^L\\) and the first payment distribution \\(N^{P}_1\\) (under deductible \\(d_1=30\\)) through \\(0.4 = \\lambda v_1\\), where \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;v_1 = \\Pr(X &gt; 30) = \\left( \\frac{150}{30+150}\\right)^4=\\left( \\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &amp; \\lambda = 0.4 \\left( \\frac{6}{5} \\right)^4 \\end{aligned}\\] With this, we can assess the second payment distribution \\(N^{P}_2\\) (under deductible \\(d_2=100\\)) as being Poisson with mean \\(\\lambda_2 = \\lambda v_2\\), where \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; v_2 = \\Pr(X&gt;100)=\\left( \\frac{150}{100+150}\\right)^4=\\left( \\frac{3}{5}\\right)^4 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &amp; \\lambda_2 = \\lambda v_2 = 0.4\\left( \\frac{6}{5} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 = 0.1075 \\end{aligned}\\] Example 5.5.3. Follow-Up. Now suppose instead that the loss frequency is \\(N^L \\sim NB(\\beta,\\ r)\\) and for deductible \\(d_1=30\\), the payment frequency \\(N^{P}_1\\) is negative binomial with mean \\(0.4\\). Find the mean of the payment frequency \\(N^{P}_2\\) for deductible \\(d_2=100\\). Show Example Solution Solution. Because the loss frequency \\(N^L\\) is negative binomial, we can relate the parameter \\(\\beta\\) of the \\(N^L\\) distribution and the parameter \\(\\beta_1\\) of the first payment distribution \\(N^{P}_1\\) using \\(\\beta_1 = \\beta v_1\\), where \\[v_1 = \\Pr(X &gt; 30) = \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^4\\] Thus, the mean of \\(N^{P}_1\\) and the mean of \\(N^L\\) are related via \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;0.4 = r \\beta_1 = r \\left(\\beta v_1\\right) \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &amp; r\\beta = \\frac{0.4}{v_1} = 0.4 \\left(\\frac{6}{5} \\right)^4 \\end{aligned}\\] Note that \\(v_2 = \\Pr(X &gt; 100) = \\left( \\frac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\) as in the original example. Then the second payment frequency distribution under deductible \\(d_2=100\\) is \\(N^{P}_2 \\sim NegBin(\\beta v_2, \\ r)\\) with mean \\[\\begin{aligned} r (\\beta v_2) = (r \\beta) v_2 = 0.4 \\left( \\frac{6}{5}\\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 = 0.1075 \\end{aligned}\\] Next, we examine the more general case where \\(N^L\\) is a zero-modified distribution. Recall that a zero-modified distribution can be defined in terms of an unmodified one (as was shown in Section 2.5.1). That is, \\[\\begin{aligned} p_k^M = c~p_k^0, {~\\rm for~} k=1,2,3,\\ldots, {~\\rm with~}c = \\frac{1-p_0^M}{1-p_0^0}, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(p^0_k\\) is the pmf of the unmodified distribution. In the case that \\(p_0^M=0\\), we call this a zero-truncated distribution, or \\(ZT\\). For other arbitrary values of \\(p_0^M\\), this is a zero-modified, or \\(ZM\\), distribution. The pgf for the modified distribution is shown as \\[\\begin{aligned} P^M(z) &amp;= 1-c+c~P^0(z), \\end{aligned}\\] expressed in terms of the pgf of the unmodified distribution, \\(P^0(z)\\). When \\(N^L\\) follows a zero-modified distribution, the distribution of \\(N^P\\) is established using the same relation from earlier, \\(P_{N^P}(z)=P_{N^L}\\left(1+v(z-1)\\right)\\). Special Cases: \\(N^{L}\\) is a ZM-Poisson random variable with parameters \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(p_0^{M}\\). The pgf of \\(N^L\\) is \\[P_{N^{L}}(z)=1-\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-e^{-\\lambda}}+\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-e^{-\\lambda}}\\left( e^{\\lambda(z-1)} \\right).\\] Thus the pgf of \\(N^P\\) is \\[P_{N^{P}}(z)=1-\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-e^{-\\lambda}}+\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-e^{-\\lambda}}\\left( e^{\\lambda v(z-1)} \\right).\\] So the number of payments is also a ZM-Poisson distribution with parameters \\(\\lambda v\\) and \\(p_0^{M}\\). The probability at zero can be evaluated using \\({\\rm Pr}(N^P=0) = P_{N^P}(0)\\). \\(N^{L}\\) is a ZM-negative binomial random variable with parameters \\(\\beta\\), \\(r\\), and \\(p_0^{M}\\). The pgf of \\(N^L\\) is \\[P_{N^{L}}(z)=1-\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-(1+\\beta)^{-r}}+\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-(1+\\beta)^{-r}}\\left[ 1-\\beta \\left( z-1\\right)\\right]^{-r}.\\] Thus the pgf of \\(N^P\\) is \\[P_{N^{P}}(z)=1-\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-(1+\\beta)^{-r}}+\\cfrac{1-p_0^{M}}{1-(1+\\beta)^{-r}}\\left[ 1-\\beta v\\left( z-1\\right)\\right]^{-r}.\\] So the number of payments is also a ZM-negative binomial distribution with parameters \\(\\beta v\\), \\(r\\), and \\(p_0^{M}\\). Similarly, the probability at zero can be evaluated using \\({\\rm Pr}(N^P=0) = P_{N^P}(0)\\). Example 5.5.4. Aggregate losses are modeled as follows: (i) The number of losses follows a zero-modified Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda=3\\) and \\(p_0^M = 0.5\\). (ii) The amount of each loss has a Burr distribution with \\(\\alpha=3, \\theta=50, \\gamma=1\\). (iii) There is a deductible of \\(d=30\\) on each loss. (iv) The number of losses and the amounts of the losses are mutually independent. Calculate \\(\\mathrm{E}(N^P)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(N^P)\\). Show Example Solution Solution. Since \\(N^L\\) follows a ZM-Poisson distribution with parameters \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(p_0^M\\), we know that \\(N^P\\) also follows a ZM-Poisson distribution, but with parameters \\(\\lambda v\\) and \\(p_0^M\\), where \\[v = \\Pr(X&gt;30) = \\left( \\frac{1}{1+(30/50)} \\right)^3 = 0.2441\\] Thus, \\(N^P\\) follows a ZM-Poisson distribution with parameters \\(\\lambda^\\ast = \\lambda v= 0.7324\\) and \\(p_0^M = 0.5\\). Finally, \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E} (N^P) &amp;= (1-p_0^M) \\frac{\\lambda^\\ast}{1-e^{-\\lambda^\\ast}} = 0.5 \\left( \\frac{0.7324}{1-e^{-0.7324}} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= 0.7053 \\\\ \\mathrm{Var} (N^P) &amp;= (1-p_0^M) \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^\\ast[1-(\\lambda^\\ast + 1) e^{-\\lambda^\\ast}]}{(1-e^{-\\lambda^\\ast})^2} \\right) + p_0^M(1-p_0^M) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^\\ast}{1-e^{-\\lambda^\\ast}} \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;= 0.5 \\left( \\frac{0.7324(1-1.7324 e^{-0.7324})}{(1-e^{-0.7324})^2} \\right) + 0.5^2 \\left( \\frac{0.7324}{1-e^{-0.7324}} \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;= 0.7244 \\end{aligned}\\] 5.5.3 Impact of Policy Modifications on Aggregate Claims In this section, we examine how a change in the deductible affects the aggregate payments from an insurance portfolio. We assume that the presence of policy limitsA policy limit is the maximum value covered by a policy. (\\(u\\)), coinsuranceCoinsurance is an arrangement whereby the insured and insurer share the covered losses. typically, a coinsurance parameter specified means that both parties receive a proportional share, e.g., 50%, of the loss. (\\(\\alpha\\)), and inflation (\\(r\\)) have no effect on the underlying distribution of frequency of payments made by an insurer. As in the previous section, we further assume that deductible changes do not impact the underlying distributions of losses for both frequency and severity. Recall the notation \\(N^L\\) for the number of losses. With ground-up lossThe total amount of loss sustained before policy adjustments are made (i.e. before deductions are applied for coinsurance, deductibles, and/or policy limits.) amount \\(X\\) and policy deductible \\(d\\), we use \\(N^P\\) for the number of payments (as defined in the previous section 5.5.2). Also, define the amount of payment on a per-loss basisDue to policy modifications (e.g. deductibles), not all losses that occur result in payment. the per-loss basis considers every loss that occurs. as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} X^{L}&amp;=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 ~, &amp; \\text{if } ~X&lt;\\cfrac{d}{1+r} \\\\ \\alpha[(1+r)X-d]~, &amp; \\text{if } ~\\cfrac{d}{1+r}\\leq X&lt;\\cfrac{u}{1+r} \\\\ \\alpha(u-d)~, &amp; \\text{if } ~X \\ge \\cfrac{u}{1+r}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right., \\end{eqnarray*}\\] and the the amount of payment on a per-payment basisDue to policy modifications (e.g. deductibles), not all losses that occur result in payment. the per-payment basis which considers only the losses that result in some payment to the insured. as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} X^{P}&amp;=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} {\\rm undefined} ~, &amp; \\text{if }~ X&lt;\\cfrac{d}{1+r} \\\\ \\alpha[(1+r)X-d]~, &amp; \\text{if }~ \\cfrac{d}{1+r}\\leq X&lt;\\cfrac{u}{1+r} \\\\ \\alpha(u-d)~, &amp; \\text{if } ~ X \\ge \\cfrac{u}{1+r}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right.. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] In the above, \\(r\\), \\(u\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) represent the inflation rate, policy limit, and coinsurance, respectively. Hence, aggregate costs (payment amounts) can be expressed either on a per loss or per payment basis: \\[\\begin{aligned} S &amp;= X^L_1 + \\cdots + X^L_{N^L} \\\\ &amp;=X^P_1 + \\cdots + X^P_{N^P} ~. \\end{aligned}\\] The fundamentals regarding collective risk models are ready to apply. For instance, we have: \\[\\begin{aligned} {\\rm E}(S) &amp;= {\\rm E}\\left(N^L\\right) {\\rm E}\\left(X^L\\right) = {\\rm E}\\left(N^P\\right) {\\rm E}\\left(X^P\\right)\\\\ {\\rm Var}(S) &amp;= {\\rm E}\\left(N^L\\right) {\\rm Var}\\left(X^L\\right) + \\left[{\\rm E}\\left(X^L\\right)\\right]^2 {\\rm Var}(N^L) \\\\ &amp;= {\\rm E}\\left(N^P\\right) {\\rm Var}\\left(X^P\\right) + \\left[{\\rm E}\\left(X^P\\right)\\right]^2 {\\rm Var}(N^P)\\\\ M_S(z)&amp;=P_{N^L}\\left[M_{X^L}(z)\\right]=P_{N^P}\\left[M_{X^P}(z)\\right] \\end{aligned}\\] Example 5.5.5. Actuarial Exam Question. A group dental policy has a negative binomial claim count distribution with mean 300 and variance 800. Ground-up severity is given by the following table: \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ c | c } \\hline \\text{Severity} &amp; \\text{Probability}\\\\ \\hline 40 &amp; 0.25\\\\ 80 &amp; 0.25\\\\ 120 &amp; 0.25\\\\ 200 &amp; 0.25\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] You expect severity to increase 50% with no change in frequency. You decide to impose a per claim deductible of 100. Calculate the expected total claim payment \\(S\\) after these changes. Show Example Solution Solution. The cost per loss with a 50% increase in severity and a 100 deductible per claim is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} X^L &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 1.5x&lt;100 \\\\ 1.5x-100 &amp; 1.5x\\ge 100\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] This has expectation \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E}(X^L) &amp;= \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\left(1.5(40)-100\\right)_+ + \\left(1.5(80)-100\\right)_+ + \\left(1.5(120)-100\\right)_+ + \\left(1.5(200)-100\\right)_+ \\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{4}\\left[ (60-100)_+ + (120-100)_+ + (180-100)_+ + (300-100)_+\\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{4}\\left[ 0 + 20 + 80 + 200 \\right] = 75 \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, the expected aggregate loss is \\[\\mathrm{E}(S)=\\mathrm{E}(N) ~ \\mathrm{E} \\left(X^L \\right)= 300 (75) = 22,500 .\\] Example 5.5.6. Follow-Up. What is the variance of the total claim payment, \\(\\mathrm{Var~}S\\)? Show Example Solution Solution. On a per loss basis, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{Var}(S) &amp;= \\mathrm{E}(N) ~ \\mathrm{Var}\\left( X^L \\right) + \\left[ \\mathrm{E} \\left(X^L\\right) \\right]^2 ~ \\mathrm{Var} (N) \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\mathrm{E}(N) = 300\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(N) = 800\\). We find \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\mathrm{E} \\left[ (X^L)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ 0^2 + 20^2 + 80^2 + 200^2 \\right] = 11,700 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ &amp; \\mathrm{Var}(X^L) = \\mathrm{E} \\left[ (X^L)^2 \\right] - \\left[ \\mathrm{E}(X^L) \\right]^2 = 11,700 - 75^2 = 6,075 \\end{aligned}\\] Thus, the variance of the aggregate claim payment is \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{Var}(S) &amp;= 300(6,075) + 75^2 (800) = 6,322,500 \\end{aligned}\\] Alternative Method: Using the Per Payment Basis. Previously, we calculated the expected total claim payment by multiplying the expected number of losses by the expected payment per loss. Recall that we can also multiply the expected number of payments by the expected payment per payment. In this case, we have \\[S=X_1^P + \\cdots + X_{N_P}^P \\] The probability of a payment is \\[\\Pr(1.5X \\ge 100)=\\Pr(X \\ge 66.\\bar{6})=\\frac{3}{4} .\\] Thus, the number of payments, \\(N^P\\) has a negative binomial distribution (see negative binomial special case in Section 5.5.2) with mean \\[\\mathrm{E}(N^P) = \\mathrm{E}(N^L)~\\Pr(1.5X \\geq 100) = 300 \\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\right)=225\\] The cost per payment is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} X^P &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{undefined}~, &amp; \\text{if }~ 1.5x&lt;100 \\\\ 1.5x-100~, &amp; \\text{if } ~ 1.5x\\ge 100\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] This has expectation \\[\\mathrm{E}(X^P)=\\frac{\\mathrm{E}(X^L)}{\\Pr(1.5X &gt; 100)}=\\frac{75}{(3/4)}=100\\] Thus, as before, the expected aggregate loss is \\[\\mathrm{E}(S)=\\mathrm{E}(X^P) ~ \\mathrm{E}(N^P) = 100(225)=22,500\\] Example 5.5.7. Actuarial Exam Question. A company insures a fleet of vehicles. Aggregate losses have a compound Poisson distribution. The expected number of losses is 20. Loss amounts, regardless of vehicle type, have exponential distribution with \\(\\theta=200\\). To reduce the cost of the insurance, two modifications are to be made: (i) A certain type of vehicle will not be insured. It is estimated that this will reduce loss frequency by 20\\(\\%\\). (ii) A deductible of 100 per loss will be imposed. Calculate the expected aggregate amount paid by the insurer after the modifications. Show Example Solution Solution. On a per loss basis, we have a 100 deductible. Thus, the expectation per loss is \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E}( X^L) &amp;= E[(X-100)_+] = E(X) - E(X\\wedge 100) \\\\ &amp;= 200 - 200(1-e^{-100/200}) = 121.31 \\end{aligned}\\] Loss frequency has been reduced by 20\\(\\%\\), resulting in an expected number of losses \\[\\mathrm{E}(N^L) = 0.8(20) = 16\\] Thus, the expected aggregate amount paid after the modifications is \\[\\mathrm{E}(S) = \\mathrm{E}(X^L)~ \\mathrm{E} (N^L) = 121.31(16) = 1,941\\] Alternative Method: Using the Per Payment Basis. We can also use the per payment basis to find the expected aggregate amount paid after the modifications. With the deductible of 100, the probability that a payment occurs is \\(\\Pr(X &gt; 100) = e^{-100/200}\\). For the per payment severity, plugging in the expression for \\(\\mathrm{E}(X^L)\\) from the original example, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E} (X^P) = \\frac{\\mathrm{E} (X^L)}{\\Pr(X &gt; 100)} = \\frac{200 - 200(1-e^{-100/200})}{e^{-100/200}} = 200 \\end{aligned}\\] This is not surprising – recall that the exponential distribution is memorylessThe memoryless property means that a given probability distribution is independent of its history and what has already elapsed. specifically, random variable x is memoryless if pr(x &gt; s+t | x &gt;= s) = pr(x &gt; t). note that it does not mean x &gt; s+t and x &gt;= s are independent events., so the expected claim amount paid in excess of 100 is still exponential with mean 200. Now we look at the payment frequency \\[\\mathrm{E} (N^P) = \\mathrm{E}(N^L)~\\Pr(X&gt;100) = 16 ~e^{-100/200} = 9.7\\] Putting this together, we produce the same answer using the per payment basis as the per loss basis from earlier \\[\\mathrm{E}(S) = \\mathrm{E} (X^P)~ \\mathrm{E} (N^P)= 200(9.7) = 1,941\\] Show Quiz Solution 5.6 Further Resources and Contributors 5.6.0.1 Exercises Here are a set of exercises that guide the viewer through some of the theoretical foundations of Loss Data Analytics.

Simulation is a computationally intensive method used to solve difficult problems. Instead of creating physical processes and experimenting with them in order to understand their operational characteristics, a simulation study is based on a computer representation - it considers various hypothetical conditions as inputs and summarizes the results. Through simulation, a vast number of hypothetical conditions can be quickly and inexpensively examined. Section 6.1 introduces simulation, a wonderful computational tool that is especially useful in complex, multivariate settings. We can also use simulation to draw from an empirical distribution - this process is known as resampling. Resampling allows us to assess the uncertainty of estimates in complex models. Section 6.2 introduces resampling in the context of bootstrapping to determine the precision of estimators. Subsequent sections introduce other topics in resampling. Section 6.3 on cross-validation shows how to use it for model selection and validation. Section 6.4 on importance sampling describes resampling in specific regions of interest, such as long-tailed actuarial applications. Section 6.5 on Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) introduces the simulation and resampling engine underpinning much of modern Bayesian analysis. 6.1 Simulation Fundamentals In this section, you learn how to: Generate approximately independent realizations that are uniformly distributed Transform the uniformly distributed realizations to observations from a probability distribution of interest Calculate quantities of interest and determining the precision of the calculated quantities 6.1.1 Generating Independent Uniform Observations The simulationsA computer generation of various hypothetical conditions and outputs, based on the model structure provided that we consider are generated by computers. A major strength of this approach is that they can be replicated, allowing us to check and improve our work. Naturally, this also means that they are not really random. Nonetheless, algorithms have been produced so that results appear to be random for all practical purposes. Specifically, they pass sophisticated tests of independence and can be designed so that they come from a single distribution - our iidIndependent and identically distributed assumption, identically and independently distributed. To get a sense as to what these algorithms do, we consider a historically prominent method. Linear Congruential Generator. To generate a sequence of random numbers, start with \\(B_0\\), a starting value that is known as a seed. This value is updated using the recursive relationship \\[B_{n+1} = a B_n + c \\text{ modulo }m, ~~ n=0, 1, 2, \\ldots .\\] This algorithm is called a linear congruential generatorAlgorithm that yields pseudo-randomized numbers calculated using a linear recursive relationship and a starting seed value. The case of \\(c=0\\) is called a multiplicative congruential generator; it is particularly useful for really fast computations. For illustrative values of \\(a\\) and \\(m\\), Microsoft’s Visual Basic uses \\(m=2^{24}\\), \\(a=1,140,671,485\\), and \\(c = 12,820,163\\) (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator). This is the engine underlying the random number generation in Microsoft’s Excel program. The sequence used by the analyst is defined as \\(U_n=B_n/m.\\) The analyst may interpret the sequence {\\(U_{i}\\)} to be (approximately) identically and independently uniformly distributed on the interval (0,1). To illustrate the algorithm, consider the following. Example 6.1.1. Illustrative Sequence. Take \\(m=15\\), \\(a=3\\), \\(c=2\\) and \\(B_0=1\\). Then we have: step \\(n\\) \\(B_n\\) \\(U_n\\) 0 \\(B_0=1\\) 1 \\(B_1 =\\mod(3 \\times 1 +2) = 5\\) \\(U_1 = \\frac{5}{15}\\) 2 \\(B_2 =\\mod(3 \\times 5 +2) = 2\\) \\(U_2 = \\frac{2}{15}\\) 3 \\(B_3 =\\mod(3 \\times 2 +2) = 8\\) \\(U_3 = \\frac{8}{15}\\) 4 \\(B_4 =\\mod(3 \\times 8 +2) = 11\\) \\(U_4 = \\frac{11}{15}\\) Sometimes computer generated random results are known as pseudo-random numbersValues that appear random but can be replicated by formula to reflect the fact that they are machine generated and can be replicated. That is, despite the fact that {\\(U_{i}\\)} appears to be i.i.d, it can be reproduced by using the same seed number (and the same algorithm). Example 6.1.2. Generating uniform random numbers in R. The following code shows how to generate three uniform (0,1) numbers in R using the runif command. The set.seed() function sets the initial seed. In many computer packages, the initial seed is set using the system clock unless specified otherwise. Three Uniform Random Variates set.seed(2017) U &lt;- runif(3) knitr::kable(U, digits=5, align = &quot;c&quot;, col.names = &quot;Uniform&quot;) Uniform 0.92424 0.53718 0.46920 The linear congruential generator is just one method of producing pseudo-random outcomes. It is easy to understand and is (still) widely used. The linear congruential generator does have limitations, including the fact that it is possible to detect long-run patterns over time in the sequences generated (recall that we can interpret independence to mean a total lack of functional patterns). Not surprisingly, advanced techniques have been developed that address some of this method’s drawbacks. 6.1.2 Inverse Transform Method With the sequence of uniform random numbers, we next transform them to a distribution of interest, say \\(F\\). A prominent technique is the inverse transform methodSamples a uniform number between 0 and 1 to represent the randomly selected percentile, then uses the inverse of the cumulative density function of the desired distribution to simulate from in order to find the simulated value from the desired distribution, defined as \\[ X_i=F^{-1}\\left( U_i \\right) . \\] Here, recall from Section 4.1.1 that we introduced the inverse of the distribution function, \\(F^{-1}\\), and referred to it also as the quantile functionInverse function for the cumulative density function which takes a percentile value in [0,1] as the input, and outputs the corresponding value in the distribution. Specifically, it is defined to be \\[ F^{-1}(y) = \\inf_x ~ \\{ F(x) \\ge y \\} . \\] Recall that \\(\\inf\\) stands for infimum or the greatest lower boundLargest value that is less than or equal to a specified subset of values/elements. It is essentially the smallest value of x that satisfies the inequality \\(\\{F(x) \\ge y\\}\\). The result is that the sequence {\\(X_{i}\\)} is approximately iid with distribution function \\(F\\). The inverse transform result is available when the underlying random variable is continuous, discrete or a hybrid combination of the two. We now present a series of examples to illustrate its scope of applications. Example 6.1.3. Generating exponential random numbers. Suppose that we would like to generate observations from an exponential distribution with scale parameter \\(\\theta\\) so that \\(F(x) = 1 - e^{-x/\\theta}\\). To compute the inverse transform, we can use the following steps: \\[ \\begin{aligned} y = F(x) &amp;\\Leftrightarrow y = 1-e^{-x/\\theta} \\\\ &amp;\\Leftrightarrow -\\theta \\ln(1-y) = x = F^{-1}(y) . \\end{aligned} \\] Thus, if \\(U\\) has a uniform (0,1) distribution, then \\(X = -\\theta \\ln(1-U)\\) has an exponential distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\). The following R code shows how we can start with the same three uniform random numbers as in Example 6.1.2 and transform them to independent exponentially distributed random variables with a mean of 10. Alternatively, you can directly use the rexp function in R to generate random numbers from the exponential distribution. The algorithm built into this routine is different so even with the same starting seed number, individual realizations will differ. set.seed(2017) U &lt;- runif(3) X1 &lt;- -10*log(1-U) set.seed(2017) X2 &lt;- rexp(3, rate = 1/10) Three Uniform Random Variates Uniform Exponential 1 Exponential 2 0.92424 25.80219 3.25222 0.53718 7.70409 8.47652 0.46920 6.33362 5.40176 Example 6.1.4. Generating Pareto random numbers. Suppose that we would like to generate observations from a Pareto distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\) so that \\(F(x) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{x+\\theta} \\right)^{\\alpha}\\). To compute the inverse transform, we can use the following steps: \\[ \\begin{aligned} y = F(x) &amp;\\Leftrightarrow 1-y = \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{x+\\theta} \\right)^{\\alpha} \\\\ &amp;\\Leftrightarrow \\left(1-y\\right)^{-1/\\alpha} = \\frac{x+\\theta}{\\theta} = \\frac{x}{\\theta} +1 \\\\ &amp;\\Leftrightarrow \\theta \\left((1-y)^{-1/\\alpha} - 1\\right) = x = F^{-1}(y) .\\end{aligned} \\] Thus, \\(X = \\theta \\left((1-U)^{-1/\\alpha} - 1\\right)\\) has a Pareto distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\). Inverse Transform Justification. Why does the random variable \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\) have a distribution function \\(F\\)? Show A Snippet of Theory This is easy to establish in the continuous case. Because \\(U\\) is a Uniform random variable on (0,1), we know that \\(\\Pr(U \\le y) = y\\), for \\(0 \\le y \\le 1\\). Thus, \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(X \\le x) &amp;= \\Pr(F^{-1}(U) \\le x) \\\\ &amp;= \\Pr(F(F^{-1}(U)) \\le F(x)) \\\\ &amp;= \\Pr(U \\le F(x)) = F(x) \\end{aligned} \\] as required. The key step is that \\(F(F^{-1}(u)) = u\\) for each \\(u\\), which is clearly true when \\(F\\) is strictly increasing. We now consider some discrete examples. Example 6.1.5. Generating Bernoulli random numbers. Suppose that we wish to simulate random variables from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter \\(p=0.85\\). Figure 6.1: Distribution Function of a Binary Random Variable A graph of the cumulative distribution function in Figure 6.1 shows that the quantile function can be written as \\[ \\begin{aligned} F^{-1}(y) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 0&lt;y \\leq 0.85 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0.85 &lt; y \\leq 1.0 . \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned} \\] Thus, with the inverse transform we may define \\[ \\begin{aligned} X = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 0&lt;U \\leq 0.85 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0.85 &lt; U \\leq 1.0 \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned} \\] For illustration, we generate three random numbers to get set.seed(2017) U &lt;- runif(3) X &lt;- 1*(U &gt; 0.85) Three Random Variates Uniform Binary X 0.92424 1 0.53718 0 0.46920 0 Example 6.1.6. Generating random numbers from a discrete distribution. Consider the time of a machine failure in the first five years. The distribution of failure times is given as: Discrete Distribution \\(~~~~~~~~~~\\) \\(~~~~~~~~~~\\) \\(~~~~~~~~~~\\) \\(~~~~~~~~~~\\) \\(~~~~~~~~~~\\) Time 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 Probability 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.4 0.2 Distribution Function \\(F(x)\\) 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.8 1.0 Figure 6.2: Distribution Function of a Discrete Random Variable Using the graph of the distribution function in Figure 6.2, with the inverse transform we may define \\[ \\small{ \\begin{aligned} X = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0&lt;U \\leq 0.1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 0.1 &lt; U \\leq 0.3\\\\ 3 &amp; 0.3 &lt; U \\leq 0.4\\\\ 4 &amp; 0.4 &lt; U \\leq 0.8 \\\\ 5 &amp; 0.8 &lt; U \\leq 1.0 . \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned} } \\] For general discrete random variables there may not be an ordering of outcomes. For example, a person could own one of five types of life insurance products and we might use the following algorithm to generate random outcomes: \\[ {\\small \\begin{aligned} X = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} \\textrm{whole life} &amp; 0&lt;U \\leq 0.1 \\\\ \\textrm{endowment} &amp; 0.1 &lt; U \\leq 0.3\\\\ \\textrm{term life} &amp; 0.3 &lt; U \\leq 0.4\\\\ \\textrm{universal life} &amp; 0.4 &lt; U \\leq 0.8 \\\\ \\textrm{variable life} &amp; 0.8 &lt; U \\leq 1.0 . \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned} } \\] Another analyst may use an alternative procedure such as: \\[ {\\small \\begin{aligned} X = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} \\textrm{whole life} &amp; 0.9&lt;U&lt;1.0 \\\\ \\textrm{endowment} &amp; 0.7 \\leq U &lt; 0.9\\\\ \\textrm{term life} &amp; 0.6 \\leq U &lt; 0.7\\\\ \\textrm{universal life} &amp; 0.2 \\leq U &lt; 0.6 \\\\ \\textrm{variable life} &amp; 0 \\leq U &lt; 0.2 . \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned} } \\] Both algorithms produce (in the long-run) the same probabilities, e.g., \\(\\Pr(\\textrm{whole life})=0.1\\), and so forth. So, neither is incorrect. You should be aware that “there is more than one way to skin a cat.” (What an old expression!) Similarly, you could use an alternative algorithm for ordered outcomes (such as failure times 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, above). Example 6.1.7. Generating random numbers from a hybrid distribution. Consider a random variable that is 0 with probability 70% and is exponentially distributed with parameter \\(\\theta= 10,000\\) with probability 30%. In an insurance application, this might correspond to a 70% chance of having no insurance claims and a 30% chance of a claim - if a claim occurs, then it is exponentially distributed. The distribution function, depicted in Figure 6.3, is given as \\[ \\begin{aligned} F(y) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; x&lt;0 \\\\ 1 - 0.3 \\exp(-x/10000) &amp; x \\ge 0 . \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned} \\] Figure 6.3: Distribution Function of a Hybrid Random Variable From Figure 6.3, we can see that the inverse transform for generating random variables with this distribution function is \\[ \\begin{aligned} X = F^{-1}(U) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 0&lt; U \\leq 0.7 \\\\ -1000 \\ln (\\frac{1-U}{0.3}) &amp; 0.7 &lt; U &lt; 1 . \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned} \\] For discrete and hybrid random variables, the key is to draw a graph of the distribution function that allows you to visualize potential values of the inverse function. 6.1.3 Simulation Precision From the prior subsections, we now know how to generate independent simulated realizations from a distribution of interest. With these realizations, we can construct an empirical distribution and approximate the underlying distribution as precisely as needed. As we introduce more actuarial applications in this book, you will see that simulation can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. Many of these applications can be reduced to the problem of approximating \\(\\mathrm{E~}h(X)\\), where \\(h(\\cdot)\\) is some known function. Based on \\(R\\) simulations (replications), we get \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_R\\). From this simulated sample, we calculate an average \\[ \\overline{h}_R=\\frac{1}{R}\\sum_{i=1}^{R} h(X_i) \\] that we use as our simulated approximate (estimate) of \\(\\mathrm{E~}h(X)\\). To estimate the precision of this approximation, we use the simulation variance \\[ s_{h,R}^2 = \\frac{1}{R-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{R}\\left( h(X_i) -\\overline{h}_R \\right) ^2. \\] From the independence, the standard error of the estimate is \\(s_{h,R}/\\sqrt{R}\\). This can be made as small as we like by increasing the number of replications \\(R\\). Example. 6.1.8. Portfolio management. In Section 3.4, we learned how to calculate the expected value of policies with deductibles. For an example of something that cannot be done with closed form expressions, we now consider two risks. This is a variation of a more complex example that will be covered as Example 10.3.6. We consider two property risks of a telecommunications firm: \\(X_1\\) - buildings, modeled using a gamma distribution with mean 200 and scale parameter 100. \\(X_2\\) - motor vehicles, modeled using a gamma distribution with mean 400 and scale parameter 200. Denote the total risk as \\(X = X_1 + X_2.\\) For simplicity, you assume that these risks are independent. To manage the risk, you seek some insurance protection. You wish to manage internally small building and motor vehicles amounts, up to \\(M\\), say. Your retained risk is \\(Y_{retained}=\\) \\(\\min(X_1 + X_2,M)\\). The insurer’s portion is \\(Y_{insurer} = X- Y_{retained}\\). To be specific, we use \\(M=\\) 400 as well as \\(R=\\) 1000000 simulations. a. With the settings, we wish to determine the expected claim amount and the associated standard deviation of (i) that retained, (ii) that accepted by the insurer, and (iii) the total overall amount. Show R Code to Define the Risks # Simulate the risks nSim &lt;- 1e6 #number of simulations set.seed(2017) #set seed to reproduce work X1 &lt;- rgamma(nSim,alpha1,scale = theta1) X2 &lt;- rgamma(nSim,alpha2,scale = theta2) # Portfolio Risks X &lt;- X1 + X2 Yretained &lt;- pmin(X, M) Yinsurer &lt;- X - Yretained Here is the code for the expected claim amounts. Show R Code To Compute Amounts # Expected Claim Amounts ExpVec &lt;- t(as.matrix(c(mean(Yretained),mean(Yinsurer),mean(X)))) sdVec &lt;- t(as.matrix(c(sd(Yretained),sd(Yinsurer),sd(X)))) outMat &lt;- rbind(ExpVec, sdVec) colnames(outMat) &lt;- c(&quot;Retained&quot;, &quot;Insurer&quot;,&quot;Total&quot;) row.names(outMat) &lt;- c(&quot;Mean&quot;,&quot;Standard Deviation&quot;) round(outMat,digits=2) Retained Insurer Total Mean 365.17 235.01 600.18 Standard Deviation 69.51 280.86 316.36 The results of these calculations are: round(outMat,digits=2) Retained Insurer Total Mean 365.17 235.01 600.18 Standard Deviation 69.51 280.86 316.36 b. For insured claims, the standard error of the simulation approximation is \\(s_{h,R}/\\sqrt{1000000} =\\) 280.86 \\(/\\sqrt{1000000} =\\) 0.281. For this example, simulation is quick and so a large value such as 1000000 is an easy choice. However, for more complex problems, the simulation size may be an issue.

Determination of Number of Simulations How many simulated values are recommended? 100? 1,000,000? We can use the central limit theoremThe sample mean and sample sum of a random sample of n from a population will converge to a normal curve as the sample size n grows to respond to this question. As one criterion for your confidence in the result, suppose that you wish to be within 1% of the mean with 95% certainty. That is, you want \\(\\Pr \\left( |\\overline{h}_R - \\mathrm{E~}h(X)| \\le 0.01 \\mathrm{E~}h(X) \\right) \\le 0.95\\). According to the central limit theorem, your estimate should be approximately normally distributed and so we want to have \\(R\\) large enough to satisfy \\(0.01 \\mathrm{E~}h(X)/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var~}h(X)/R}) \\ge 1.96\\). (Recall that 1.96 is the 97.5th percentile from the standard normal distribution.) Replacing \\(\\mathrm{E~}h(X)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var~}h(X)\\) with estimates, you continue your simulation until \\[ \\frac{.01\\overline{h}_R}{s_{h,R}/\\sqrt{R}}\\geq 1.96 \\] or equivalently \\[\\begin{equation} R \\geq 38,416\\frac{s_{h,R}^2}{\\overline{h}_R^2}. \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] This criterion is a direct application of the approximate normality. Note that \\(\\overline{h}_R\\) and \\(s_{h,R}\\) are not known in advance, so you will have to come up with estimates, either by doing a small pilot study in advance or by interrupting your procedure intermittently to see if the criterion is satisfied. Example. 6.1.8. Portfolio management - continued For our example, the average insurance claim is 235.011 and the corresponding standard deviation is 280.862. Using equation (6.1), to be within 10% of the mean, we would only require at least 54.87 thousand simulations. However, to be within 1% we would want at least 5.49 million simulations. Example. 6.1.9. Approximation choices. An important application of simulation is the approximation of \\(\\mathrm{E~}h(X)\\). In this example, we show that the choice of the \\(h(\\cdot)\\) function and the distribution of \\(X\\) can play a role. Consider the following question : what is \\(\\Pr[X&gt;2]\\) when \\(X\\) has a Cauchy distributionA continuous distribution that represents the distribution of the ratio of two independent normally random variables, where the denominator distribution has mean zero, with density \\(f(x) =\\left(\\pi(1+x^2)\\right)^{-1}\\), on the real line? The true value is \\[ \\Pr\\left[X&gt;2\\right] = \\int_2^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\pi(1+x^2)} . \\] One can use an R numerical integration function (which works usually well on improper integrals) true_value &lt;- integrate(function(x) 1/(pi*(1+x^2)),lower=2,upper=Inf)$value which is equal to 0.14758. Alternatively, one can use simulation techniques to approximate that quantity. From calculus, you can check that the quantile function of the Cauchy distribution is \\(F^{-1}(y) = \\tan \\left( \\pi(y-0.5) \\right)\\). Then, with simulated uniform (0,1) variates, \\(U_1, \\ldots, U_R\\), we can construct the estimator \\[ p_1 = \\frac{1}{R}\\sum_{i=1}^R \\mathrm{I}(F^{-1}(U_i)&gt;2) = \\frac{1}{R}\\sum_{i=1}^R \\mathrm{I}(\\tan \\left( \\pi(U_i-0.5) \\right)&gt;2) . \\] Show the R Code Q &lt;- function(u) tan(pi*(u-.5)) R &lt;- 1e6 set.seed(1) X &lt;- Q(runif(R)) p1 &lt;- mean(X&gt;2) se.p1 &lt;- sd(X&gt;2)/sqrt(R) p1 [1] 0.147439 se.p1 [1] 0.0003545432 With one million simulations, we obtain an estimate of 0.14744 with standard error 0.355 (divided by 1000). One can prove that the variance of \\(p_1\\) is of order \\(0.127/R\\). With other choices of \\(h(\\cdot)\\) and \\(F(\\cdot)\\), it is actually possible to reduce uncertainty even using the same number of simulations R. To begin, one can use the symmetry of the Cauchy distribution to write \\(\\Pr[X&gt;2]=0.5\\cdot\\Pr[|X|&gt;2]\\). With this, can construct a new estimator \\[ p_2 = \\frac{1}{2R}\\sum_{i=1}^R \\mathrm{I}(|F^{-1}(U_i)|&gt;2) . \\] With one million simulations, we obtain an estimate of 0.14748 with standard error 0.228 (divided by 1000). One can prove that the variance of \\(p_2\\) is of order \\(0.052/R\\). But one can go one step further. The improper integral can be written as a proper one by a simple symmetry property (since the function is symmetry and the integral on the real line is equal to \\(1\\)) \\[ \\int_2^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\pi(1+x^2)}=\\frac{1}{2}-\\int_0^2\\frac{dx}{\\pi(1+x^2)} . \\] From this expression, a natural approximation would be \\[ p_3 = \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{R}\\sum_{i=1}^R h_3(2U_i), ~~~~~~\\text{where}~h_3(x)=\\frac{2}{\\pi(1+x^2)} . \\] With one million simulations, we obtain an estimate of 0.14756 with standard error 0.169 (divided by 1000). One can prove that the variance of \\(p_3\\) is of order \\(0.0285/R\\). Finally, one can also consider some change of variable in the integral \\[ \\int_2^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\pi(1+x^2)}=\\int_0^{1/2}\\frac{y^{-2}dy}{\\pi(1-y^{-2})} . \\] From this expression, a natural approximation would be \\[ p_4 = \\frac{1}{R}\\sum_{i=1}^R h_4(U_i/2),~~~~~\\text{where}~h_4(x)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi(1+x^2)} . \\] The expression seems rather similar to the previous one, With one million simulations, we obtain an estimate of 0.14759 with standard error 0.01 (divided by 1000). One can prove that the variance of \\(p_4\\) is of order \\(0.00009/R\\), which is much smaller than what we had so far ! Table 6.1 summarizes the four choices of \\(h(\\cdot)\\) and \\(F(\\cdot)\\) to approximate \\(\\Pr[X&gt;2] =\\) 0.14758. The standard error varies dramatically. Thus, if we have a desired degree of accuracy, then the number of simulations depends strongly on how we write the integrals we try to approximate. Table 6.1.

In particular, they are very useful when distributions of test statistics are too complicated to derive; in this case, one can use simulations to approximate the reference distribution. We now illustrate this with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov testA nonparametric statistical test used to determine if a data sample could come from a hypothesized continuous probability distribution that we learned about in Section 4.1.2.2. Example. 6.1.10. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test of Distribution. Suppose that we have available \\(n=100\\) observations \\(\\{x_1,\\cdots,x_n\\}\\) that, unknown to the analyst, was generated from a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha = 6\\) and \\(\\theta=2\\). The analyst believes that the data come from a lognormal distribution with parameters 1 and 0.4 and would like to test this assumption. The first step is to visualize the data. Show R Code To Set up The Visualization set.seed(1) n &lt;- 100 x &lt;- rgamma(n, 6, 2) u=seq(0,7,by=.01) vx = c(0,sort(x)) vy = (0:n)/n With this set-up, Figure 6.5 provides a graph of a histogram and empirical distribution. For reference, superimposed are red dashed lines from the lognormal distribution. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) hist(x,probability = TRUE,main=&quot;Histogram&quot;, col=&quot;light blue&quot;,border=&quot;white&quot;,xlim=c(0,7),ylim=c(0,.4)) lines(u,dlnorm(u,1,.4),col=&quot;red&quot;,lty=2) plot(vx,vy,type=&quot;l&quot;,xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;Cumulative Distribution&quot;,main=&quot;Empirical cdf&quot;) lines(u,plnorm(u,1,.4),col=&quot;red&quot;,lty=2) Figure 6.5: Histogram and Empirical Distribution Function of Data used in Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. The red dashed lines are fits based on (incorrectly) hypothesized lognormal distribution. Recall that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic equals the largest discrepancy between the empirical and the hypothesized distribution. This is \\(\\max_x |F_n(x)-F_0(x)|\\), where \\(F_0\\) is the hypothesized lognormal distribution.

We can use simulation to test the relevance of the test statistic. Specifically, to compute the \\(p\\)-value, let us generate thousands of random samples from a \\(LN(1,0.4)\\) distribution (with the same size), and compute empirically the distribution of the statistic, Show R Code for the Simulation Distribution of the KS Statistic ns &lt;- 1e4 d_KS &lt;- rep(NA,ns) # compute the test statistics for a large (ns) number of simulated samples for(s in 1:ns) d_KS[s] &lt;- D(rlnorm(n,1,.4),function(x) plnorm(x,1,.4)) mean(d_KS&gt;D(x,function(x) plnorm(x,1,.4))) [1] 0.2843 hist(d_KS,probability = TRUE,col=&quot;light blue&quot;,border=&quot;white&quot;,xlab=&quot;Test Statistic&quot;,main=&quot;&quot;) lines(density(d_KS),col=&quot;red&quot;) abline(v=D(x,function(x) plnorm(x,1,.4)),lty=2,col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 6.6: Simulated Distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test Statistic. The vertical red dashed line marks the test statistic for the sample of 100. The simulated distribution based on 10,000 random samples is summarized in Figure 6.6. Here, the statistic exceeded the empirical value (0.09704) in 28.43% of the scenarios, while the theoretical \\(p\\)-value is 0.3031. For both the simulation and the theoretical \\(p\\)-values, the conclusions are the same; the data do not provide sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis of a lognormal distribution. Although only an approximation, the simulation approach works in a variety of distributions and test statistics without needing to develop the nuances of the underpinning theory for each situation. We summarize the procedure for developing simulated distributions and p-values as follows: Draw a sample of size n, say, \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), from a known distribution function \\(F\\). Compute a statistic of interest, denoted as \\(\\hat{\\theta}(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)\\). Call this \\(\\hat{\\theta}^r\\) for the rth replication. Repeat this \\(r=1, \\ldots, R\\) times to get a sample of statistics, \\(\\hat{\\theta}^1, \\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}^R\\). From the sample of statistics in Step 2, \\(\\{\\hat{\\theta}^1, \\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}^R\\}\\), compute a summary measure of interest, such as a p-value. 6.2 Bootstrapping and Resampling In this section, you learn how to: Generate a nonparametric bootstrap distribution for a statistic of interest Use the bootstrap distribution to generate estimates of precision for the statistic of interest, including bias, standard deviations, and confidence intervals Perform bootstrap analyses for parametric distributions 6.2.1 Bootstrap Foundations Simulation presented up to now is based on sampling from a known distribution. Section 6.1 showed how to use simulation techniques to sample and compute quantities from known distributions. However, statistical science is dedicated to providing inferences about distributions that are unknown. We gather summary statistics based on this unknown population distribution. But how do we sample from an unknown distribution? Naturally, we cannot simulate draws from an unknown distribution but we can draw from a sample of observations. If the sample is a good representation from the population, then our simulated draws from the sample should well approximate the simulated draws from a population. The process of sampling from a sample is called resampling or bootstrapping. The term bootstrapA method of sampling with replacement from the original dataset to create additional simulated datasets of the same size as the original comes from the phrase “pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps” (Efron, 1979). With resampling, the original sample plays the role of the population and estimates from the sample play the role of true population parameters. The resampling algorithm is the same as introduced in Section 6.1.4 except that now we use simulated draws from a sample. It is common to use \\(\\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\}\\) to denote the original sample and let \\(\\{X_1^*, \\ldots, X_n^*\\}\\) denote the simulated draws. We draw them with replacement so that the simulated draws will be independent from one another, the same assumption as with the original sample. For each sample, we also use n simulated draws, the same number as the original sample size. To distinguish this procedure from the simulation, it is common to use B (for bootstrap) to be the number of simulated samples. We could also write \\(\\{X_1^{(b)}, \\ldots, X_n^{(b)}\\}\\), \\(b=1,\\ldots, B\\) to clarify this. There are two basic resampling methods, model-free and model-based, which are, respectively, as nonparametric and parametric. In the nonparametric approachA statistical method where no assumption is made about the distribution of the population, no assumption is made about the distribution of the parent population. The simulated draws come from the empirical distribution function \\(F_n(\\cdot)\\), so each draw comes from \\(\\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\}\\) with probability 1/n. In contrast, for the parametric approachA statistical method where a prior assumption is made about the distribution or model form, we assume that we have knowledge of the distribution family F. The original sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) is used to estimate parameters of that family, say, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). Then, simulated draws are taken from the \\(F(\\hat{\\theta})\\). Section 6.2.4 discusses this approach in further detail. Nonparametric Bootstrap The idea of the nonparametric bootstrap is to use the inverse method on \\(F_n\\), the empirical cumulative distribution function, depicted in Figure 6.7. Figure 6.7: Inverse of an Empirical Distribution Function Because \\(F_n\\) is a step-function, \\(F_n^{-1}\\) takes values in \\(\\{x_1,\\cdots,x_n\\}\\). More precisely, as illustrated in Figure 6.8. if \\(y\\in(0,1/n)\\) (with probability \\(1/n\\)) we draw the smallest value (\\(\\min\\{x_i\\}\\)) if \\(y\\in(1/n,2/n)\\) (with probability \\(1/n\\)) we draw the second smallest value, … if \\(y\\in((n-1)/n,1)\\) (with probability \\(1/n\\)) we draw the largest value (\\(\\max\\{x_i\\}\\)). Figure 6.8: Inverse of an Empirical Distribution Function Using the inverse method with \\(F_n\\) means sampling from \\(\\{x_1,\\cdots,x_n\\}\\), with probability \\(1/n\\). Generating a bootstrap sample of size \\(B\\) means sampling from \\(\\{x_1,\\cdots,x_n\\}\\), with probability \\(1/n\\), with replacement. See the following illustrative R code. Show R Code For Creating a Bootstrap Sample set.seed(1) n &lt;- 10 x &lt;- rexp(n, 1/6) m &lt;- 8 bootvalues &lt;- sample(x, size=m, replace=TRUE) [1] 7.0899 0.8742 0.8388 4.5311 0.8388 5.7394 0.8388 2.6164 Observe that value 0.8388 was obtained three times. 6.2.2 Bootstrap Precision: Bias, Standard Deviation, and MSE We summarize the nonparametric bootstrap procedure as follows: From the sample \\(\\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\}\\), draw a sample of size n (with replacement), say, \\(X_1^*, \\ldots, X_n^*\\). From the simulated draws compute a statistic of interest, denoted as \\(\\hat{\\theta}(X_1^*, \\ldots, X_n^*)\\). Call this \\(\\hat{\\theta}_b^*\\) for the bth replicate. Repeat this \\(b=1, \\ldots, B\\) times to get a sample of statistics, \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1^*, \\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}_B^*\\). From the sample of statistics in Step 2, \\(\\{\\hat{\\theta}_1^*, \\ldots, \\hat{\\theta}_B^*\\}\\), compute a summary measure of interest. In this section, we focus on three summary measures, the biasThe difference between the expected value of an estimator and the parameter being estimated. bias is an estimation error that does not become smaller as one observes larger sample sizes., the standard deviation, and the mean square error (MSE). Table 6.2 summarizes these three measures. Here, \\(\\overline{\\hat{\\theta^*}}\\) is the average of \\(\\{\\hat{\\theta}_1^*, \\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}_B^*\\}\\). \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 6.2.

Bodily Injury Claims and Loss Elimination Ratios. To show how the bootstrap can be used to quantify the precision of estimators, we return to the Example 4.1.11 bodily injury claims data where we introduced a nonparametric estimator of the loss elimination ratio. Table 6.3 summarizes the results of the bootstrap estimation. For example, at \\(d=14000\\), we saw in Example 4.1.11 that the nonparametric estimate of LER is 0.97678. This has an estimated bias of 0.00018 with a standard deviation of 0.00701. For some applications, you may wish to apply the estimated bias to the original estimate to give a bias-corrected estimatorIf an estimator is known to be consistently biased in a manner, it can be corrected using a factor to be come less biased or unbiased. This is the focus of the next example. For this illustration, the bias is small and so such a correction is not relevant.

For one application of standard deviations, we can use the normal approximation to create a confidence interval. For example, the R function boot.ci produces the normal confidence intervals at 95%. These are produced by creating an interval of twice the length of 1.95994 bootstrap standard deviations, centered about the bias-corrected estimator (1.95994 is the 97.5th quantile of the standard normal distribution). For example, the lower normal 95% CI at \\(d=14000\\) is \\((0.97678-0.00018)- 1.95994*0.00701\\) \\(= 0.96286\\). We further discuss bootstrap confidence intervals in the next section. Example 6.2.2. Estimating \\(\\exp(\\mu)\\). The bootstrap can be used to quantify the bias of an estimator, for instance. Consider here a sample \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\{x_1,\\cdots,x_n\\}\\) that is iidIndependent and identically distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\). sample_x &lt;- c(2.46,2.80,3.28,3.86,2.85,3.67,3.37,3.40,5.22,2.55, 2.79,4.50,3.37,2.88,1.44,2.56,2.00,2.07,2.19,1.77) Suppose that the quantity of interest is \\(\\theta=\\exp(\\mu)\\). A natural estimator would be \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_1=\\exp(\\overline{x})\\). This estimator is biased (due to the Jensen inequalityFor a convex function f(x), f(expected value of x) &lt;= expected value of f(x)) but is asymptotically unbiased. For our sample, the estimate is as follows. (theta_1 &lt;- exp(mean(sample_x))) [1] 19.13463 One can use the central limit theorem to get a correction using \\[ \\overline{X}\\approx\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu,\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)\\text{ where }\\sigma^2=\\text{Var}[X_i] , \\] so that, with the normal moment generating function, we have \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\exp[\\overline{X}] \\approx \\exp\\left(\\mu+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2n}\\right) . \\] Hence, one can consider naturally \\[ \\widehat{\\theta}_2=\\exp\\left(\\overline{x}-\\frac{\\widehat{\\sigma}^2}{2n}\\right) . \\] For our data, this turns out to be as follows. n &lt;- length(sample_x) (theta_2 &lt;- exp(mean(sample_x)-var(sample_x)/(2*n))) [1] 18.73334 As another strategy (that we do not pursue here), one can also use Taylor’s approximation to get a more accurate estimator (as in the delta method), \\[ g(\\overline{x})=g(\\mu)+(\\overline{x}-\\mu)g&#39;(\\mu)+(\\overline{x}-\\mu)^2\\frac{g&#39;&#39;(\\mu)}{2}+\\cdots \\] The alternative we do explore is to use a bootstrap strategy: given a bootstrap sample, \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}_{b}\\), let \\(\\overline{x}^{\\ast}_{b}\\) denotes its mean, and set \\[ \\widehat{\\theta}_3=\\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^B\\exp(\\overline{x}^{\\ast}_{b}) . \\] To implement this, we have the following code. Show R Code for Creating Bootstrap Samples library(boot) results &lt;- boot(data=sample_x, statistic=function(y,indices) exp(mean(y[indices])), R=1000) theta_3 &lt;- mean(results$t) Then, you can plot(results) and print(results) to see the following. Figure 6.9: Distribution of Bootstrap Replicates. The left-hand panel is a histogram of replicates. The right-hand panel is a quantile-quantile plot, comparing the bootstrap distribution to the standard normal distribution.

How does this work with differing sample sizes?

True value of the parameter is given by the solid horizontal line at 5.20. 6.2.3 Confidence Intervals The bootstrap procedure generates B replicates \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1^*, \\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}_B^*\\) of the estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). In Example 6.2.1, we saw how to use standard normal approximations to create a confidence interval for parameters of interest. However, given that a major point is to use bootstrapping to avoid relying on assumptions of approximate normality, it is not surprising that there are alternative confidence intervals available. For an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), the basic bootstrap confidence interval is \\[\\begin{equation} \\left(2 \\hat{\\theta} - q_U, 2 \\hat{\\theta} - q_L \\right) , \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(q_L\\) and \\(q_U\\) are lower and upper 2.5% quantiles from the bootstrap sample \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1^*, \\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}_B^*\\). To see where this comes from, start with the idea that \\((q_L, q_U)\\) provides a 95% interval for \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1^*, \\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}_B^*\\). So, for a random \\(\\hat{\\theta}_b^*\\), there is a 95% chance that \\(q_L \\le \\hat{\\theta}_b^* \\le q_U\\). Reversing the inequalities and adding \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) to each side gives a 95% interval \\[ \\hat{\\theta} -q_U \\le \\hat{\\theta} - \\hat{\\theta}_b^* \\le \\hat{\\theta} -q_L . \\] So, \\(\\left( \\hat{\\theta}-q_U, \\hat{\\theta} -q_L\\right)\\) is an 95% interval for \\(\\hat{\\theta} - \\hat{\\theta}_b^*\\). The bootstrap approximation idea says that this is also a 95% interval for \\(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta}\\). Adding \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) to each side gives the 95% interval in equation (6.2). Many alternative bootstrap intervals are available. The easiest to explain is the percentile bootstrap intervalConfidence interval for the parameter estimates determined using the actual percentile results from the bootstrap sampling approach, as every bootstrap sample has an associated parameter estimate(s) that can be ranked against the others which is defined as \\(\\left(q_L, q_U\\right)\\). However, this has the drawback of potentially poor behavior in the tails which can be of concern in some actuarial problems of interest. Example 6.2.3. Bodily Injury Claims and Risk Measures. To see how the bootstrap confidence intervals work, we return to the bodily injury auto claims considered in Example 6.2.1. Instead of the loss elimination ratio, suppose we wish to estimate the 95th percentile \\(F^{-1}(0.95)\\) and a measure defined as \\[ TVaR_{0.95)}[X] = \\mathrm{E}[X | X &gt; F^{-1}(0.95)] . \\] This measure is called the tail value-at-riskThe expected value of a risk given that the risk exceeds a value-at-risk; it is the expected value of \\(X\\) conditional on \\(X\\) exceeding the 95th percentile. Section 10.2 explains how quantiles and the tail value-at-risk are the two most important examples of so-called risk measures. For now, we will simply think of these as measures that we wish to estimate. For the percentile, we use the nonparametric estimator \\(F^{-1}_n(0.95)\\) defined in Section 4.1.1.3. For the tail value-at-risk, we use the plug-in principle to define the nonparametric estimator \\[ TVaR_{n,0.95}[X] = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i I(X_i &gt; F^{-1}_n(0.95))}{\\sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i &gt; F^{-1}_n(0.95))} ~. \\] In this expression, the denominator counts the number of observations that exceed the 95th percentile \\(F^{-1}_n(0.95)\\). The numerator adds up losses for those observations that exceed \\(F^{-1}_n(0.95)\\). Table 6.4 summarizes the estimator for selected fractions.

These form the percentile bootstrap confidence interval. With the nonparametric estimator 6500, these yield the lower and upper bounds of the basic confidence interval 6297 and 7000, respectively. Table 6.4 also shows bootstrap estimates of the bias, standard deviation, and a normal confidence interval, concepts introduced in the prior section. Table 6.5 shows similar calculations for the tail value-at-risk. In each case, we see that the bootstrap standard deviation increases as the fraction increases. This is a reflection of the fewer observations available to estimate quantiles as the fraction increases, hence greater imprecision. Width of confidence intervals also increase. Interestingly, there does not seem to be the same pattern in the estimates of the bias.

In contrast, with parametric bootstrap, we draw independent variables from \\(F_{\\widehat{\\theta}}\\) where the underlying distribution is assume to be in a parametric family \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{F_{\\theta},\\theta\\in\\Theta\\}\\). Typically, parameters from this distribution are estimated based on a sample and denoted as \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). Example 6.2.4. Lognormal distribution.

Bootstrapping Censored Observations. The parametric bootstrap draws simulated realizations from a parametric estimate of the distribution function. In the same way, we can draw simulated realizations from estimates of a distribution function. As one example, we might draw from smoothed estimates of a distribution function introduced in Section 4.1.1.4. Another special case, considered here, is to draw an estimate from the Kaplan-Meier estimator introduced in Section 4.3.2.2. In this way, we can handle observations that are censored. Specifically, return to the bodily injury data in Examples 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 but now we include the 17 claims that were censored by policy limits. In Example 4.3.6, we used this full dataset to estimate the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function introduced in Section 4.3.2.2. Table 6.6 present bootstrap estimates of the quantiles from the Kaplan-Meier survival function estimator. These include the bootstrap precision estimates, bias and standard deviation, as well as the basic 95% confidence interval.

In Table 6.6, we note the difficulty in estimating quantiles at large fractions due to the censoring. However, for moderate size fractions (0.50, 0.80, and 0.90), the Kaplan-Meier nonparametric (KM NP) estimates of the quantile are consistent with those Table 6.4. The bootstrap standard deviation is smaller at the 0.50 (corresponding to the median) but larger at the 0.80 and 0.90 levels. The censored data analysis summarized in Table 6.6 uses more data than the uncensored subsample analysis in Table 6.4 but also has difficulty extracting information for large quantiles. 6.3 Cross-Validation In this section, you learn how to: Compare and contrast cross-validation to simulation techniques and bootstrap methods. Use cross-validation techniques for model selection Explain the jackknife method as a special case of cross-validation and calculate jackknife estimates of bias and standard errors Cross-validation, briefly introduced in Section 4.2.4, is a technique based on simulated outcomes and so let’s think about its purposes in contrast to other simulation techniques already introduced in this chapter. Simulation, or Monte-Carlo, introduced in Section 6.1, allow us to compute expected values and other summaries of statistical distributions, such as \\(p\\)-values, readily. Bootstrap, and other resampling methods introduced in Section 6.2, provide estimators of the precision, or variability, of statistics. Cross-validation is important when assessing how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. Overlap exists but nonetheless it is helpful to think about the broad goals as associated with each statistical method. To discuss cross-validation, let us recall from Section 4.2 some of the key ideas of model validation. When assessing, or validating, a model, we look to performance measured on new data, or at least not those that were used to fit the model. A classical approach, described in Section 4.2.3, is to split the sample in two: a subpart (the training dataset) is used to fit the model and another one (the testing dataset) is used to validate. However, a limitation of this approach is that results depend on the split; even though the overall sample is fixed, the split between training and test subsamples varies randomly. A different training sample means that model estimated parameters will differ. Different model parameters and a different test sample means that validation statistics will differ. Two analysts may use the same data and same models yet reach different conclusions about the viability of a model (based on different random splits), a frustrating situation. 6.3.1 k-Fold Cross-Validation To mitigate this difficulty, it is common to use a cross-validation approach as introduced in Section 4.2.4. The key idea is to emulate the basic test/training approach to model validation by repeating it many times through averaging over different splits of the data. A key advantage is that the validation statistic is not tied to a specific parametric (or nonparametric) model - one can use a nonparametric statistic or a statistic that has economic interpretations - and so this can be used to compare models that are not nested (unlike likelihood ratio procedures). Example 6.3.1. Wisconsin Property Fund. For the 2010 property fund data introduced in Section 1.3, we fit gamma and Pareto distributions to the 1,377 claims data. For details of the related goodness of fit, see Appendix Section 15.4.4. We now consider the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic introduced in Section 4.1.2.2. When the entire dataset was fit, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit statistic for the gamma distribution turns out to be 0.0478 and for the Pareto distribution is 0.2639. The lower value for the Pareto distribution indicates that this distribution is a better fit than the gamma. To see how k-fold cross-validationA type of validation method where the data is randomly split into k groups, and each of the k groups is held out as a test dataset in turn, while the other k-1 gropus are used for distribution or model fitting, with the process repeated k times in total works, we randomly split the data into \\(k=8\\) groups, or folds, each having about \\(1377/8 \\approx 172\\) observations. Then, we fit gamma and Pareto models to a data set with the first seven folds (about \\(172*7 = 1204\\) observations), determine estimated parameters, and then used these fitted models with the held-out data to determine the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.

This process was repeated for the other seven folds. The results summarized in Figure 6.12 show that the Pareto consistently provides a more reliable predictive distribution than the gamma. # Plot the statistics matplot(1:k,t(cvalvec),type=&quot;b&quot;, col=c(1,3), lty=1:2, ylim=c(0,0.4), pch = 0, xlab=&quot;Fold&quot;, ylab=&quot;KS Statistic&quot;) legend(&quot;left&quot;, c(&quot;Pareto&quot;, &quot;Gamma&quot;), col=c(1,3),lty=1:2, bty=&quot;n&quot;) Figure 6.12: Cross Validated Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Statistics for the Property Fund Claims Data. The solid black line is for the Pareto distribution, the green dashed line is for the gamma distribution. The KS statistic measures the largest deviation between the fitted distribution and the empirical distribution for each of 8 groups, or folds, of randomly selected data. 6.3.2 Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation A special case where \\(k=n\\) is known as leave-one-out cross validationA special case of k-fold cross validation, where each single data point gets a turn in being the lone hold-out test data point, and n separate models in total are built and tested. This case is historically prominent and is closely related to jackknife statisticsTo calculate an estimator, leave out each observation in turn, calculate the sample estimator statistic each time, and average over the n separate estimates, a precursor of the bootstrap technique. Even though we present it as a special case of cross-validation, it is helpful to given an explicit definition. Consider a generic statistic \\(\\widehat{\\theta}=t(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) that is an estimator for a parameter of interest \\(\\theta\\). The idea of the jackknife is to compute \\(n\\) values \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_{-i}=t(\\boldsymbol{x}_{-i})\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_{-i}\\) is the subsample of \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) with the \\(i\\)-th value removed. The average of these values is denoted as \\[ \\overline{\\widehat{\\theta}}_{(\\cdot)}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\widehat{\\theta}_{-i} . \\] These values can be used to create estimates of the bias of the statistic \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) \\[\\begin{equation} Bias_{jack} = (n-1) \\left(\\overline{\\widehat{\\theta}}_{(\\cdot)} - \\widehat{\\theta}\\right) \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] as well as a standard deviation estimate \\[\\begin{equation} s_{jack} =\\sqrt{\\frac{n-1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\widehat{\\theta}_{-i} -\\overline{\\widehat{\\theta}}_{(\\cdot)}\\right)^2} ~. \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] Example 6.3.2. Coefficient of Variation. To illustrate, consider a small fictitious sample \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=\\{x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\}\\) with realizations sample_x &lt;- c(2.46,2.80,3.28,3.86,2.85,3.67,3.37,3.40, 5.22,2.55,2.79,4.50,3.37,2.88,1.44,2.56,2.00,2.07,2.19,1.77) Suppose that we are interested in the coefficient of variationStandard deviation divided by the mean of a distribution, to measure variability in terms of units of the mean \\(\\theta = CV = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var~}X}/\\mathrm{E~}X\\). With this dataset, the estimator of the coefficient of variation turns out to be 0.31196. But how reliable is it? To answer this question, we can compute the jackknife estimates of bias and its standard deviation. The following code shows that the jackknife estimator of the bias is \\(Bias_{jack} =\\) -0.00627 and the jackknife standard deviation is \\(s_{jack} =\\) 0.01293.

Bodily Injury Claims and Loss Elimination Ratios. In Example 6.2.1, we showed how to compute bootstrap estimates of the bias and standard deviation for the loss elimination ratio using the Example 4.1.11 bodily injury claims data. We follow up now by providing comparable quantities using jackknife statistics. Table 6.7 summarizes the results of the jackknife estimation. It shows that jackknife estimates of the bias and standard deviation of the loss elimination ratio \\(\\mathrm{E}~\\min(X,d)/\\mathrm{E}~X\\) are largely consistent with the bootstrap methodology. Moreover, one can use the standard deviations to construct normal based confidence intervals, centered around a bias-corrected estimator. For example, at \\(d=14000\\), we saw in Example 4.1.11 that the nonparametric estimate of LER is 0.97678. This has an estimated bias of 0.00010, resulting in the (jackknife) bias-corrected estimator 0.97688. The 95% confidence intervals are produced by creating an interval of twice the length of 1.96 jackknife standard deviations, centered about the bias-corrected estimator (1.96 is the approximate 97.5th quantile of the standard normal distribution).

One of the many interesting things about the leave-one-out special case is the ability to replicate estimates exactly. That is, when the size of the fold is only one, then there is no additional uncertainty induced by the cross-validation. This means that analysts can exactly replicate work of one another, an important consideration. Jackknife statistics were developed to understand precision of estimators, producing estimators of bias and standard deviation in equations (6.3) and (6.4). This crosses into goals that we have associated with bootstrap techniques, not cross-validation methods. This demonstrates how statistical techniques can be used to achieve different goals. 6.3.3 Cross-Validation and Bootstrap The bootstrap is useful in providing estimators of the precision, or variability, of statistics. It can also be useful for model validation. The bootstrap approach to model validation is similar to the leave-one-out and k-fold validation procedures: Create a bootstrap sample by re-sampling (with replacement) \\(n\\) indices in \\(\\{1,\\cdots,n\\}\\). That will be our training sample. Estimate the model under consideration based on this sample. The test, or validation sample, consists of those observations not selected for training. Evaluate the fitted model (based on the training data) using the test data. Repeat this process many (say \\(B\\)) times. Take an average over the results and choose the model based on the average evaluation statistic. Example 6.3.4. Wisconsin Property Fund. Return to Example 6.3.1 where we investigate the fit of the gamma and Pareto distributions on the property fund data. We again compare the predictive performance using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic but this time using the bootstrap procedure to split the data between training and testing samples. The following provides illustrative code.

The average KS statistic for the Pareto distribution was 0.058 compared to the average for the gamma distribution, 0.261. This is consistent with earlier results and provides another piece of evidence that the Pareto is a better model for these data than the gamma. 6.4 Importance Sampling Section 6.1 introduced Monte Carlo techniques using the inversion technique : to generate a random variable \\(X\\) with distribution \\(F\\), apply \\(F^{-1}\\) to calls of a random generator (uniform on the unit interval). What if we what to draw according to \\(X\\), conditional on \\(X\\in[a,b]\\) ? One can use an accept-reject mechanismA sampling method that is used where the random sample is discarded if not within a certain pre-specified range [a, b] and is commonly used when the traditional inverse transform method cannot be easily used : draw \\(x\\) from distribution \\(F\\) if \\(x\\in[a,b]\\) : keep it (“accept”) if \\(x\\notin[a,b]\\) : draw another one (“reject”) Observe that from \\(n\\) values initially generated, we keep here only \\([F(b)-F(a)]\\cdot n\\) draws, on average. Example 6.4.1. Draws from a Normal Distribution. Suppose that we draw from a normal distribution with mean 2.5 and variance 1, \\(N(2.5,1)\\), but are only interested in draws greater that \\(a \\ge 2\\) and less than \\(b \\le 4\\).

It is here to give you a flavor of what will be in the final version. The idea of Monte Carlo techniques rely on the law of large number (that insures the convengence of the average towards the integral) and the central limit theorem (that is used to quantify uncertainty in the computations). Recall that if \\((X_i)\\) is an i.id. sequence of random variables with distribution \\(F\\), then \\[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n h(X_i)-\\int h(x)dF(x)\\right)\\overset{\\mathcal{L}}{\\rightarrow }\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2),\\text{ as }n\\rightarrow\\infty. \\] for some variance \\(\\sigma^2&gt;0\\). But actually, the ergodic theoremErgodic theory studies the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for an extended time can be used to weaker the previous result, since it is not necessary to have independence of the variables. More precisely, if \\((X_i)\\) is a Markov ProcessA stochastic (time dependent) process that satisfies memorylessness, meaning future predictions of the process can be made solely based on its present state and not the historical path with invariant measureAny mathematical measure that is preserved by a function (the mean is an example) \\(\\mu\\), under some additional technical assumptions, we can obtain that \\[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n h(X_i)-\\int h(x)d\\mu(x)\\right)\\overset{\\mathcal{L}}{\\rightarrow }\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_\\star^2),\\text{ as }n\\rightarrow\\infty. \\] for some variance \\(\\sigma_\\star^2&gt;0\\). Hence, from this property, we can see that it is possible not necessarily to generate independent values from \\(F\\), but to generate a markov process with invariante measure \\(F\\), and to consider means over the process (not necessarily independent). Consider the case of a constraint Gaussian vector : we want to generate random pairs from a random vector \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\), but we are interested only on the case where the sum of the composantsComponent (smaller, self-contained part of larger entity) is large enough, which can be written \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^T\\boldsymbol{1}&gt; m\\) for some real valued \\(m\\). Of course, it is possible to use the accept-reject algorithm, but we have seen that it might be quite inefficient. One can use Hastings MetropolisA markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method for random sampling from a probability distribution where values are iteratively generated, with the distribution of the next sample dependent only on the current sample value, and at each iteration, the candidate sample can be either accepted or rejected and Gibbs samplerA markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method to obtain a sequence of random samples from a specified multivariate continuous probability distribution to generate a Markov process with such an invariant measure. 6.5.1 Hastings Metropolis The algorithm is rather simple to generate from \\(f\\) : we start with a feasible value \\(x_1\\). Then, at step \\(t\\), we need to specify a transition kernel : given \\(x_t\\), we need a conditional distribution for \\(X_{t+1}\\) given \\(x_t\\). The algorithm will work well if that conditional distribution can easily be simulated. Let \\(\\pi(\\cdot|x_t)\\) denote that probability. Draw a potential value \\(x_{t+1}^\\star\\), and \\(u\\), from a uniform distribution. Compute \\[ R= \\frac{f(x_{t+1}^\\star)}{f(x_t)} \\] and if \\(u &lt; r\\), then set \\(x_{t+1}=x_t^\\star\\) if \\(u\\leq r\\), then set \\(x_{t+1}=x_t\\) Here \\(r\\) is called the acceptance-ratio: we accept the new value with probability \\(r\\) (or actually the smallest between \\(1\\) and \\(r\\) since \\(r\\) can exceed \\(1\\)). For instance, assume that \\(f(\\cdot|x_t)\\) is uniform on \\([x_t-\\varepsilon,x_t+\\varepsilon]\\) for some \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\), and where \\(f\\) (our target distribution) is the \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\). We will never draw from \\(f\\), but we will use it to compute our acceptance ratio at each step.

Setting prices for insurance products, premiums, is an important task for actuaries and other data analysts. This chapter introduces the foundations for pricing non-life products. 7.1 Introduction to Ratemaking In this section, you learn how to: Describe expectations as a baseline method for determining insurance premiums Analyze an accounting equation for relating premiums to losses, expenses and profits Summarize a strategy for extending pricing to include heterogeneous risks and trends over time This chapter explains how you can think about determining the appropriate price for an insurance product. As described in Section 1.2, one of the core actuarial functions is ratemakingProcess used by insurers to calculate insurance rates, which drive insurance premiums, where the analyst seeks to determine the right price for a risk. As this is a core function, let us first take a step back to define terms. A priceA quantity, usually of money, that is exchanged for a good or service is a quantity, usually of money, that is exchanged for a good or service. In insurance, we typically use the word premiumAmount of money an insurer charges to provide the coverage described in the policy for the amount of money charged for insurance protection against contingent events. The amount of protection varies by risk being insured. For example, in homeowners insurance the amount of insurance protection depends on the value of the house. In life insurance, the amount of protection depends on a policyholder’s financial status (e.g. income and wealth) as well as a perceived need for financial security. So, it is common to express insurance prices as a unit of the protection being purchased, for example, an amount per thousands (e.g., of dollars or Euros) for coverage of a home or benefit in the event of death. Because they are expressed in standardized units, these prices/premiums are known as ratesA rate is the price, or premium, charged per unit of exposure. a rate is a premium expressed in standardized units.. To determine premiums, it is common in economics to consider the supply and demand of a product. The demand is sensitive to price as well as the existence of competiting firms and substitute products. The supply is a function of the resources required for production. For the individual firm, the price is set to meet some objective such as profit maximization which is met by choosing the output level that balances costs and revenues at the margins. However, a peculiarity of insurance is that the costs of insurance protection are not known at the sale of the contract. If the insured contingent eventA condition that results in an insurance claim, such as the loss of a house or life, does not occur, then the contract costs are only administrative (to set up the contract) and are relatively minor. If the insured event occurs, then the cost includes not only administrative costs but also payment of the amount insured and expenses to settle claims. So, the cost is random; when the contract is written, by design neither the insurer nor the insured knows the contract costs. Moreover, costs may not be revealed for months or years. For example, a typical time to settlement in medical malpractice is five years. Because costs are unknown at the time of sale, insurance pricing differs from common economic approaches. This chapter squarely addresses the uncertain nature of costs by introducing traditional actuarial approaches that determine prices as a function of insurance costs. As we will see, this pricing approach is sufficient for some insurance markets such as personal automobile or homeowners where the insurer has a portfolio of many independent risks. However, there are other insurance markets where actuarial prices only provide an input to general market prices. To reinforce this distinction, actuarial cost-based premiums are sometimes known as technical prices. From the perspective of economists, corporate decisions such as pricing are to be evaluated with reference to their impact on the firm’s market value. This objective is more comprehensive than the static notion of profit maximization. That is, you can think of the value of the firm represents the capitalized value of all future expected profits. Decisions impacting this value in turn affect all groups having claims on the firm, including stockholders, bondholders, policyowners (in the case of mutual companies), and so forth. For cost-based prices, it is helpful to think of a premium as revenue source that provides for claim payments, contract expenses, and an operating margin. We formalize this in an accounting equation \\[\\begin{equation} \\small{ \\text{Premium = Loss + Expense + UW Profit} . } \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] Expenses can be split into those that vary by premium (such as sales commissions) and those that do not (such as building costs and employee salaries). The term UW Profit is a residual that stands for underwriting profitProfit an insurer derives from providing coverage, excluding investment income. It may also include include a cost of capital (for example, an annual dividend to company investors). Because fixed expenses and costs of capital are difficult to interpret for individual contracts, we think of the equation (7.1) relationship as holding over the sum of many contracts (a portfolio) and work with it in aggregate. Then, in Section 7.2 we use this approach to help us think about setting premiums, for example by setting profit objectives. Specifically, Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 introduce two prevailing methods used in practice for determining premiums, the pure premiumPure premium is the total severity divided by the number of claims. it does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. also called loss costs. some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae). and the loss ratioThe sum of losses divided by the premium. methods. The Loss in equation (7.1) is random and so, as a baseline, we use the expected costs to determine rates. There are several ways to motivate this perspective that we expand upon in Section 7.3. For now, we will suppose that the insurer enters into many contracts with risks that are similar except, by pure chance, in some cases the insured event occurs and in others it does not. The insurer is obligated to pay the total amount of claims payments for all contracts. If risks are similar, then all policyholders should be responsible for the same amount which is the average claim payment. So, from this perspective, it makes sense to look at the average claim payment over many insureds. From probability theory, specifically the law of large numbers, we know that the average of iidIndependent and identically distributed risks is close to the expected amount, so we use the expectation as a baseline pricing principle. Nonetheless, by using expected losses, we essentially assume that the uncertainty is non-existent. If the insurers sells enough independent policies, this may be a reasonable approximation. However, there will be other cases, such as a single contract issued to a large corporation to insure all of its buildings against fire damage, where the use of only an expectation for pricing is not sufficient. So, Section 7.3 also summarizes alternative premium principles that incorporate uncertainty into our pricing. Note that an emphasis of this text is estimation of the entire distribution of losses so the analyst is not restricted to working only with expectations. The aggregate methods derived from equation (7.1) focus on collections of homogeneous risksRisks that have the same distribution, that is, the distributions are identical. that are similar except for the occurrence of random losses. In statistical language that we have introduced, this is a discussion about risks that have identical distributions. Naturally, when examining risks that insurers work with, there are many variations in the risks being insured including the features of the contracts and the people being insured. Section 7.4 extends pricing considerations to heterogeneousHeterogeneous risks have different distributions. often, we can attribute differences to varying exposures or risk factors. collections of risks. Section 7.5 introduces ideas of development and trending. When developing rates, we want to use the most recent loss experience because the goal is to develop rates that are forward looking. However, at contract initiation, recent loss experience is often not known; it may be several years until it is fully realized. So, this section introduces concepts needed for incorporating recent loss experience into our premium development. Development and trending of experience is related to but also differs from the idea of experience ratingA type of rating plan that uses the insured’s historical loss experience as part of the premium determination that suggests that experience reveals hidden information about the insured and so should be incorporated in our forward thinking viewpoint. Chapter 9 discusses this idea in more detail. The final section of this chapter introduces methods for selecting a premium. This is done by comparing a premium rating method to losses from a held-out portfolio and selecting the method that produces the best match with the held-out data. For a typical insurance portfolio, most policies produce zero losses, that is, do not have a claim. Because the distribution of held-out losses is a combination of (a large number of) zeros and continuous amounts, special techniques are useful. Section 7.6 introduces concepts of concentration curves and corresponding Gini statistics to help in this selection. The chapter also includes a technical supplement on government regulation of insurance ratesAmount of money needed to cover losses, expenses, and profit per one unit of exposure to keep our work grounded in applications. 7.2 Aggregate Ratemaking Methods In this section, you learn how to: Define a pure premium as a loss cost as well as in terms of frequency and severity Calculate an indicated rate using pure premiums, expenses, and profit loadings Define a loss ratio Calculate an indicated rate change using loss ratios Compare the pure premium and loss ratio methods for determining premiums It is common to consider an aggregate portfolio of insurance experience. Consistent with earlier notation, consider a collection of n contracts with losses \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). In this section, we assume that contracts have the same loss distribution, that is they form a homogeneous portfolio, and so are iidIndependent and identically distributed. For motivation, you can think about personal insurance such as auto or homeowners where insurers write many contracts on risks that appear very similar. Further, the assumption of identical distributions is not as limiting as you might think. In Section 7.4.1 we will introduce the idea of an exposureA type of rating variable that is so important that premiums and losses are often quoted on a “per exposure” basis. that is, premiums and losses are commonly standardized by exposure variables. variable that allows us to rescale experience to make it comparable. For example, by rescaling losses we will be able to treat homeowner losses from a 100,000 house and a 200,000 house as coming from the same distribution. For now, we simply assume that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) are iid. 7.2.1 Pure Premium Method If the number in the group, n, is large, then the average provides a good approximation of the expected loss \\[ \\small{ \\mathrm{E}(X) \\approx \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} = \\frac{\\text{Loss}}{\\text{Exposure}} = \\text{Pure Premium}. } \\] With this as motivation, we define the pure premiumPure premium is the total severity divided by the number of claims. it does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. also called loss costs. some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae). to be the sum of losses divided by the exposure; it is also known as a loss costThe sum of losses divided by an exposure; it is also known as the pure premium.. In the case of homogeneous risksRisks that have the same distribution, that is, the distributions are identical., all policies are treated the same and we can use the number of policies n for the exposure. In Section 7.4.1 we extend the concept of exposure when policies are not the same. We can multiply and divide by the number of claims, claim count, to get \\[ \\small{ \\text{Pure Premium} = \\frac{\\text{claim count}}{\\text{Exposure}} \\times \\frac{\\text{Loss}}{\\text{claim count}} = \\text{frequency} \\times \\text{severity} . } \\] So, when premiums are determined using the pure premium method, we either take the average loss (loss cost) or use the frequency severity approach. To get a bit closer to applications in practice, we now return to equation (7.1) that includes expenses. Equation (7.1) also refers to UW Profit for underwriting profit. When rescaled by premiums, this is known as the profit loadingA factor or percentage applied to the premium calculation to account for insurer profit in a policy. Because claims are uncertain, the insurer must hold capital to ensure that all claims are paid. Holding this extra capital is a cost of doing business, investors in the company need to be compensated for this, thus the extra loading. We now decompose Expenses into those that vary by premium, Variable, and those that do not, Fixed so that Expenses = Variable + Fixed. Thinking of variable expenses and profit as a fraction of premiums, we define \\[ \\small{ V = \\frac{\\text{Variable}}{\\text{Premium}} ~~~ \\text{and}~~~ Q = \\frac{\\text{UW Profit}}{\\text{Premium}} ~. } \\] With these definitions and equation (7.1), we may write \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Premium} &amp;= \\text{Losses + Fixed} + \\text{Premium} \\times \\frac{\\text{Variable + UW Profit}}{\\text{Premium}} \\\\ &amp; = \\text{Losses + Fixed} + \\text{Premium} \\times (V+Q) . \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Solving for premiums yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\small{ \\text{Premium} = \\frac{\\text{Losses + Fixed}}{1-V-Q} . } \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] Dividing by exposure, the rate can be calculated as \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Rate} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Premium}}{\\text{Exposure}} = \\frac{\\text{Losses/Exposure + Fixed/Exposure}}{1-V-Q} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Pure Premium + Fixed/Exposure}}{1-V-Q} ~. \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] In words, this is \\[ \\small{ \\text{Rate} =\\frac{\\text{pure premium + fixed expense per exposure}}{\\text{1 - variable expense factor - profit and contingencies factor}} . } \\] Example. CAS Exam 5, 2004, Number 13. Determine the indicated rateIn a rate filing, the amount that the loss experience suggests that the insurer should charge to cover costs. per exposure unit, given the following information: Frequency per exposure unit = 0.25 Severity = $100 Fixed expense per exposure unit = $10 Variable expense factor = 20% Profit and contingencies factor = 5% Show Example Solution Solution. Under the pure premium method, the indicated rate is \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Rate} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{pure premium + fixed expense per exposure}}{\\text{1 - variable expense factor - profit and contingencies factor}}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\text{frequency} \\times \\text{severity} ~+~10}{1-0.20-0.05} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 100 +10}{1-0.20-0.05} = 46.67 . \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] From the example, note that the rates produced by the pure premium method are commonly known as indicated rates. From our development, note also that the profit is associated with underwriting aspect of the contract and not investments. Premiums are typically paid at the beginning of a contract and insurers receive investment income from holding this money. However, due in part to the short-term nature of the contracts, investment income is typically ignored in pricing. This builds a bit of conservatism into the process that insurers welcome. It is probably most relevant in the very long “tail” lines such as workers’ compensation and medical malpractice. In these lines, it can sometimes take 20 years or even longer to settle claims. But, these are also the most volatile lines; claim payments far in the future are less extreme when viewed in discounted sense. 7.2.2 Loss Ratio Method The loss ratioThe sum of losses divided by the premium. is the ratio of the sum of losses to the premium \\[ \\small{ \\text{Loss Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Loss}}{\\text{Premium}} . } \\] When determining premiums, it is a bit counter-intuitive to emphasize this ratio because the premium component is built into the denominator. As we will see, the idea is that the loss ratio method develops rate changes rather than rates; we can use rate changes to update past experience to get a current rate. To do this, rate changes consist of the ratio of the experience loss ratio to the target loss ratio. This adjustment factor is then applied to current rates to get new indicated rates. To see how this works in a simple context, let us return to equation (7.1) but now ignore expenses to get \\(\\small{\\text{Premium = Losses + UW Profit}}\\). Dividing by premiums yields \\[ \\small{ \\frac{\\text{UW Profit}}{\\text{Premium}} = 1 - LR = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Loss}}{\\text{Premium}} . } \\] Suppose that we have in mind a new “target” profit loading, say \\(Q_{target}\\). Assuming that losses, exposure, and other things about the contract stay the same, then to achieve the new target profit loading we adjust the premium. Use the ICF for the indicated change factorA factor calculated from the loss ratio method that calculates how the rates should change, with factors &gt; 1 indicating an increase and vice versa that is defined through the expression \\[ \\small{ \\frac{\\text{new UW Profit}}{\\text{Premium}} = Q_{target} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Loss}}{ICF \\times \\text{Premium}}. } \\] Solving for ICF, we get \\[ \\small{ ICF = \\frac{\\text{Loss}}{\\text{Premium} \\times (1-Q_{target})} = \\frac{LR}{1-Q_{target}}. } \\] So, for example, if we have a current loss ratio = 85% and a target profit loading \\(\\small{Q_{target}=0.20}\\), then \\(\\small{ICF = 0.85/0.80 = 1.0625}\\), meaning that we increase premiums by 6.25%. Now let’s see how this works with expenses in equation (7.1). We can use the same development as in Section 7.2.1 and so start with equation (7.2), solve for the profit loading to get \\[ \\small{ Q = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Loss+Fixed}}{\\text{Premium}} - V . } \\] We interpret the quantity Fixed /Premium + V as the “operating expense ratio.” Now, fix the profit percentage Q at a target and adjust premiums through the “indicated change factor” \\(ICF\\) \\[ \\small{ Q_{target} = 1 -\\frac{\\text{Loss + Fixed}}{\\text{Premium}\\times ICF} - V . } \\] Solving for \\(ICF\\) yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\small{ ICF = \\frac{\\text{Loss + Fixed}}{\\text{Premium} \\times (1 - V - Q_{target})} . } \\tag{7.3} \\end{equation}\\] Example. Loss Ratio Indicated Change Factor. Assume the following information: Projected ultimate loss and LAE ratio = 65% Projected fixed expense ratio = 6.5% Variable expense = 25% Target UW profit = 10% With these assumptions, with equation (7.3), the indicated change factor can be calculated as \\[ \\small{ ICF = \\frac{\\text{(Losses + Fixed)}/\\text{Premium}}{ 1 - V - Q_{target}} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.065}{1- 0.25 - 0.10} = 1.10 . } \\] This means that overall average rate level should be increased by 10%. We later provide a comparison of the pure premium and loss ratio methods in Section 7.5.3. As inputs, this section will require discussions of trended exposures and on-level premiums defined in Section 7.5. 7.3 Pricing Principles In this section, you learn how to: Describe common actuarial pricing principles Describe properties of pricing principles Choose a pricing principle based on a desired property Approaches to pricing vary by the type of contract. For example, personal automobile is common (it is known as part of the retail general insurance market in the United Kingdom). Here, one can expect to do pricing based on a large pool of independent contracts, a situation in which expectations of losses provide an excellent starting point. In contrast, an actuary may wish to price an insurance contract issued to a large employer that covers complex health benefits for thousands of employees. In this example, knowledge of the entire distribution of potential losses, not just the expected value, is critical for starting the pricing negotiations. To cover a range of potential applications, this section describes general premium principles and their properties that one can use to decide whether or not a specific principle is applicable in a given situation. 7.3.1 Premium Principles This chapter introduces traditional actuarial pricing principles that provide a price based only on the insurance loss distribution; the price does not depend on the demand for insurance or other aspects of the costs such as expenses. Assume that the loss \\(X\\) has a distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) and that there exists some functional \\(H\\) that takes \\(F(\\cdot)\\) into the positive real line, denoted as \\(P = H(F)\\). For notation purposes, it is often convenient to substitute the random variable \\(X\\) for its distribution function and write \\(P = H(X)\\). Table 7.1 provides several examples. Table 7.1: Common Premium Principles Description Definition (\\(H(X)\\)) Net (pure) premium \\(E[X]\\) Expected value \\((1+\\alpha)E[X]\\) Standard deviation \\(E[X]+\\alpha ~SD(X)\\) Variance \\(E[X]+\\alpha ~Var(X)\\) Zero utility solution of \\(u(w) = E ~u(w + P - X)\\) Exponential \\(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln E ~e^{\\alpha X}\\) A premium principle is similar to a risk measureA measure that summarizes the riskiness, or uncertainty, of a distribution that is introduced in Section 10.3. Mathematically, both are functions that maps the loss rvRandom variable of interest to a numerical value. From a practical viewpoint, a premium principle provides a guide as to how much an insurer will charge for accepting a risk \\(X\\). In contrast, a risk measure quantifies the level of uncertainty, or riskiness, that an insurer can use to decide on a capital level to be assured of remaining solvent. As noted above, the net, or pure, premium essentially assumes no uncertainty. The expected value, standard deviation, and variance principles each add an explicit loading for riskiness through parameter \\(\\alpha \\ge 0\\). For the principle of zero utility, we think of an insurer with utility function \\(u(\\cdot)\\) and wealth w as being indifferent to accepting and not accepting risk \\(X\\). In this case, \\(P\\) is known as an indifference price or, in economics, a reservation price. With exponential utilility, the principle of zero utility reduces to the exponential premium principle, that is, assuming \\(u(x) = (1-e^{-\\alpha x})/\\alpha\\). For small values of risk parameters, the variance principle is approximately equal to exponential premium principle, as illustrated in the following special case. Special Case: Gamma Distribution. Consider a loss that is gamma distributed with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\). From the Appendix D in 18, the mean is \\(\\alpha \\theta\\) and the variance is \\(\\alpha \\theta^2\\). Using \\(\\alpha_{Var}\\) for the risk parameter, the variance premium is \\(H_{Var}(X) = \\alpha \\theta+\\alpha_{Var} ~(\\alpha \\theta^2)\\). From this appendix, it is straightforward to derive the well-known moment generating function, \\(M(t) = E e^{tX} = (1-t\\theta)^{-\\alpha}\\). With this and a risk parameter \\(\\alpha_{Exp}\\), we may express the exponential premium as \\[ H_{Exp}(X) = \\frac{-\\alpha}{\\alpha_{Exp}} \\ln\\left(1-\\alpha_{Exp} \\theta\\right). \\] To see the relationship between \\(H_{Var}(X)\\) and \\(H_{Var}(X)\\), we choose \\(\\alpha_{Exp} = 2 \\alpha_{Var}\\). With an approximation from calculus (\\(\\ln(1-x) = -x - x^2/2 - x^3/3 - \\cdots\\)), we write \\[ H_{Exp}(X) = \\frac{-\\alpha}{\\alpha_{Exp}} \\ln\\left(1-\\alpha_{Exp} \\theta\\right) = \\frac{-\\alpha}{\\alpha_{Exp}} \\left\\{ -\\alpha_{Exp} \\theta -(\\alpha_{Exp} \\theta)^2/2 - \\cdots\\right\\} \\\\ \\approx \\alpha \\theta + \\frac{\\alpha_{Exp}}{2}(\\alpha \\theta^2 ) = H_{Var}(X). \\] 7.3.2 Properties of Premium Principles Properties of premium principles help guide the selection of a premium principle in applications. Table 7.2 provides examples of properties of premium principles. Table 7.2: Common Properties of Premium Principles Description Definition Nonnegative loading \\(H(X) \\ge E[X]\\) Additivity \\(H(X_1+X_2) = H(X_1) + H(X_2)\\), for independent \\(X_1, X_2\\) Scale invariance \\(H(cX) = c H(X)\\), for \\(c \\ge 0\\) Consistency \\(H(c+X) = c + H(X)\\) No rip-off \\(H(X) \\le max ~range ~\\{X\\}\\) This is simply a subset of the many properties quoted in the actuarial literature. For example, the review paper of Young (2014) lists 15 properties. See also the properties described as coherent axioms that we introduce for risk measures in Section 10.3. Some of the properties listed in Table 7.2 are mild in the sense that they will nearly always be satisfied. For example, the no rip-off property indicates that the premium charge will be smaller than the maximal value of the loss \\(X\\). Other properties may not be so mild. For example, for a portfolio of independent risks, the actuary may want the additivity property to hold. It is easy to see that this property holds for the expected value, variance, and exponential premium principles but not for the standard deviation principle. Another example is the consistency property that does not hold for the expected value principle when the risk loading parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is positive. The scale invariance principle is known as homogeneity of degree one in economics. It allows, for example, us to work in different currencies (e.g., from dollars to Euros) as well as a host of other applications and will be discussed further in the following Section 7.4. Although a generally accepted principle, we note that this principle does not hold for a large values of \\(X\\) that may border on a surplus constraint of an insurer; if an insurer has a large probability of becoming insolvent, then that insurer may not wish to use linear pricing. It is easy to check that this principle holds for the expected value and standard deviation principles, although not for the variance and exponential principles. 7.4 Heterogeneous Risks In this section, you learn how to: Describe insurance exposures in terms of scale distributions Explain an exposure in terms of common types of insurance such as auto and homeowners insurance Describe how rating factors can be used to account for the heterogeneity among risks in a collection Measure the impact of a rating factor through relativities As noted in Section 7.1, there are many variations in the risks being insured, the features of the contracts, and the people being insured. As an example, you might have a twin brother or sister who works in the same town and earns a roughly similar amount of money. Still, when it comes to selecting choices in rental insurance to insure contents of your apartment, you can imagine differences in the amount of contents to be insured, choices of deductibles for the amount of risk retained, and perhaps different levels of uncertainty given the relative safety of your neighborhoods. People, and risks that they insure, are different. When thinking about a collection of different, or heterogeneousHeterogeneous risks have different distributions. often, we can attribute differences to varying exposures or risk factors., risks, one option is to price all risks the same. This is common, for example, in government sponsored programs for flood or health insurance. However, it is also common to have different prices where the differences are commensurate with the risk being insured. 7.4.1 Exposure to Risk One easy way to make heterogeneous risks comparable is through the concept of an exposureA type of rating variable that is so important that premiums and losses are often quoted on a “per exposure” basis. that is, premiums and losses are commonly standardized by exposure variables.. To explain exposures, let us use scale distributions that we learned about in Chapter 3. To recall a scale distributionSuppose that y = c x, where x comes from a parametric distribution family and c is a positive constant. the distribution is said to be a scale distribution if (i) the distributions of y and x come from the same family and (ii) only a single parameter differs and that by a factor of c., suppose that \\(X\\) has a parametric distributionModel assumption that the sample data comes from a population that can be modeled by a probability distribution with a fixed set of parameters and define a rescaled version \\(R = X/E\\), \\(E &gt; 0\\). If \\(R\\) is in the same parametric family as \\(X\\), then the distribution is said to be a scale distribution. As we have seen, the gamma, exponential, and Pareto distributions are examples of scale distributions. Intuitively, the idea behind exposures is to make risks more comparable to one another. For example, it may be that risks \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) come from different distributions and yet, with the choice of the right exposures, the rates \\(R_1, \\ldots, R_n\\) come from the same distribution. Here, we interpret the rate \\(R_i = X_i/E_i\\) to be the loss divided by exposure. Table 7.3 provides a few examples. We remark that this table refers to “earned” car and house years, concepts that will be explained in Section 7.5. \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Type of Insurance} &amp; \\text{Exposure Basis} \\\\\\hline \\text{Personal Automobile} &amp; \\text{Earned Car Year, Amount of Insurance Coverage} \\\\ \\text{Homeowners} &amp; \\text{Earned House Year, Amount of Insurance Coverage}\\\\ \\text{Workers Compensation} &amp; \\text{Payroll}\\\\ \\text{Commercial General Liability} &amp; \\text{Sales Revenue, Payroll, Square Footage, Number of Units}\\\\ \\text{Commercial Business Property} &amp; \\text{Amount of Insurance Coverage}\\\\ \\text{Physician&#39;s Professional Liability} &amp; \\text{Number of Physician Years}\\\\ \\text{Professional Liability} &amp; \\text{Number of Professionals (e.g., Lawyers or Accountants)}\\\\ \\text{Personal Articles Floater} &amp; \\text{Value of Item} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 7.3 : Commonly used Exposures in Different Types of Insurance An exposure is a type of rating factorA rating factor, or rating variable, is a characteristic of the policyholder or risk being insured by which rates vary., a concept that we define explicitly in the next Section 7.4.2. It is typically the most important rating factor, so important that both premiums and losses are quoted on a “per exposure” basis. For frequency and severity modeling, it is customary to think about the frequency aspect as proportional to exposure and the severity aspect in terms of loss per claim (not dependent upon exposure). However, this does not cover the entire story. For many lines of business, it is convenient for exposures to be proportional to inflation. Inflation is typically viewed as unrelated to frequency but proportional to severity. Criteria for Choosing an Exposure An exposure base should meet the following criteria. It should: be an accurate measure of the quantitative exposure to loss be easy for the insurer to determine (at the time the policy is calculated) and not subject to manipulation by the insured, be easy to understand by the insured and to calculate by the insurer, consider any preexisting exposure base established within the industry, and for some lines of business, it is proportional to inflation. In this way, rates are not sensitive to the changing value of money over time as these changes are captured in exposure base. To illustrate, consider personal automobile coverage. Instead of the exposure basis “earned car year,” a more accurate measure of the quantitative exposure to loss might be number of miles driven. However, this measure is difficult to determine at the time the policy is issued and subject to potential manipulation by the insured. As another example, the exposure measure in commercial business propertyLine of business that insures against damage to their buildings and contents due to a covered cause of loss, e.g. fire insurance, is typically the amount of insurance coverage. As property values grow with inflation, so will the amount of insurance coverage. Thus, rates quoted on a per amount of insurance coverage are less sensitive to inflation than otherwise. 7.4.2 Rating Factors A rating factor, or rating variableA rating factor, or rating variable, is a characteristic of the policyholder or risk being insured by which rates vary., is simply a characteristic of the policyholder or risk being insured by which rates vary. For example, when you purchase auto insurance, it is likely that the insurer has rates that differ by age, gender, type of car and where it is garaged, accident history, and so forth. These variables are known as rating factors. Although some variables may be continuous, such as age, most are categorical - factorA variable that varies by groups or categories. is a label that is used for categorical variables. In fact, even with continuous variablesType of variable that can take on any real value such as age, it is common to categorize them by creating groups such as “young,” “intermediate,” and “old” for rating purposes. Table 7.4 provides just a few examples. In many jurisdictions, the personal insurance market (e.g., auto and homeowners) is very competitive - using 10 or 20 variables for rating purposes is not uncommon. \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|l}\\hline \\text{Type of Insurance} &amp; \\text{Rating Factors}\\\\\\hline\\hline \\text{Personal Automobile} &amp; \\text{Driver Age and Gender, Model Year, Accident History}\\\\ \\text{Homeowners} &amp; \\text{Amount of Insurance, Age of Home, Construction Type}\\\\ \\text{Workers Compensation} &amp; \\text{Occupation Class Code}\\\\ \\text{Commercial General Liability} &amp; \\text{Classification, Territory, Limit of Liability}\\\\ \\text{Medical Malpractice} &amp; \\text{Specialty, Territory, Limit of Liability}\\\\ \\text{Commercial Automobile} &amp; \\text{Driver Class, Territory, Limit of Liability}\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 7.4 : Commonly used Rating Factors in Different Types of Insurance Example. Losses and Premium by Amount of Insurance and Territory. To illustrate, Table 7.5 presents a small fictitious data set from Werner and Modlin (2016). The data consists of loss and loss adjustment expenses (LossLAE), decomposed by three levels of AOI, amount of insurance, and three territories (Terr). For each combination of AOI and Terr, we also have available the number of policies issued, given as the Exposure. \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{cc|rrr} \\hline AOI &amp; Terr &amp; Exposure &amp; LossLAE &amp; Premium \\\\\\hline \\text{Low} &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 210.93 &amp; 335.99 \\\\ \\text{Medium} &amp; 1 &amp; 108 &amp; 4,458.05 &amp; 6,479.87 \\\\ \\text{High} &amp; 1 &amp; 179 &amp; 10,565.98 &amp; 14,498.71 \\\\\\hline \\text{Low} &amp; 2 &amp; 130 &amp; 6,206.12 &amp; 10,399.79 \\\\ \\text{Medium} &amp; 2 &amp; 126 &amp; 8,239.95 &amp; 12,599.75 \\\\ \\text{High} &amp; 2 &amp; 129 &amp; 12,063.68 &amp; 17,414.65 \\\\\\hline \\text{Low} &amp; 3 &amp; 143 &amp; 8,441.25 &amp; 14,871.70 \\\\ \\text{Medium} &amp; 3 &amp; 126 &amp; 10,188.70 &amp; 16,379.68 \\\\ \\text{High} &amp; 3 &amp; 40 &amp; 4,625.34 &amp; 7,019.86 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; &amp; 988 &amp; 65,000.00 &amp; 99,664.01 \\\\\\hline \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 7.5 : Losses and Premium by Amount of Insurance and Territory In this case, the rating factors AOI and Terr produce nine cells. Note that one might combine the cell “territory one with a low amount of insurance”&quot; with another cell because there are only 7 policies in that cell. Doing so is perfectly acceptable - considerations of this sort is one of the main jobs of the analyst. An outline on selecting variables is in Chapter 8, including Technical Supplement TS 8.B. Alternatively, you can also think about reinforcing information about the cell (Terr 1, Low AOI) by “borrowing” information from neighboring cells (e.g., other territories with the same AOI, or other amounts of AOI within Terr 1). This is the subject of credibilityWeight assigned to observed data vs. that assigned to an external or broader-based set of data that is introduced in Chapter 9. To understand the impact of rating factors, it is common to use relativities. A relativityThe difference of the expected risk between a specific level of a rating factor and an accepted baseline value. this difference may be arithmetic or proportional. is the difference of the expected risk between a specific level of a rating factor and an accepted baseline value. In this book, we work with relativities defined through ratios; it is also possible to define relativities through arithmetic differences. Thus, our relativity is defined as \\[ \\text{Relativity}_j = \\frac{\\text{(Loss/Exposure)}_j}{\\text{(Loss/Exposure)}_{Base}} . \\] Example. Losses and Premium by Amount of Insurance and Territory - Continued. Traditional classification methods consider only one classification variable at a time - they are univariate. Thus, if we wanted relativities losses and expenses (LossLAE) by amount of insurance, we might sum over territories to get the information displayed in Table 7.6. \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{c|rrrr} \\hline AOI &amp; Exposure &amp; LossLAE &amp; Loss/Exp &amp;Relativity \\\\\\hline \\text{Low} &amp; 280 &amp; 14858.3 &amp; 53.065 &amp;0.835 \\\\ \\text{Medium} &amp; 360 &amp; 22886.7 &amp; 63.574 &amp;1.000 \\\\ \\text{High} &amp; 348 &amp; 27255.0 &amp; 78.319 &amp; 1.232 \\\\\\hline \\text{Total} &amp; 988 &amp; 65,000.0 &amp; \\\\\\hline \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 7.6 : Losses and Relativities by Amount of Insurance Thus, for example, losses and expenses per unit of exposure are 23.2% higher for risks with a high amount of insurance compared to those with a medium amount. These relativities do not control for territory. The introduction of rating factors allows the analyst to create cells that define small collections of risks – the goal is to choose the right combination of rating factors so that all risks within a cell may be treated the same. In statistical terminology, we want all risks within a cell to have the same distribution (subject to rescaling by an exposure variable). This is the foundation of insurance pricing. All risks within a cell have the same price yet risks from different cells may have different prices. Said another way, insurers are allowed to charge different rates for different risks; discriminationProcess of determining premiums on the basis of likelihood of loss. insurance laws prohibit “unfair discrimination”. of risks is legal and routinely done. Nonetheless, the basis of discrimination, the choice of risk factors, is the subject of extensive debate. The actuarial community, insurance management, regulators, and consumer advocates are all active participants in this debate. Technical Supplement TS 7.A describes these issues from a regulatory perspective. In addition to statistical criteria for assessing the significance of a rating factor, analysts much pay attention to business concerns of the company (e.g., is it expensive to implement a rating factor?), social criteria (is a variable under the control of a policyholder?), legal criteria (are there regulations that prohibit the use of a rating factor such as gender?), and other societal issues. These questions are largely beyond the scope of this text. Nonetheless, because they are so fundamental to pricing of insurance, a brief overview is given in Chapter 8, including Technical Supplement TS 8.B. 7.5 Development and Trending In this section, you learn how to: Define and calculate different types of exposure and premium summary measures that appear in financial reports Describe the development of a claim over several payments and link that to various unpaid claim measures, including those incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as case reserves Compare and contrast relative strengths and weaknesses of the pure premium and loss ratio methods for ratemaking As we have seen in Section 7.2, insurers consider aggregate information for ratemaking such as exposures to risk, premiums, expenses, claims, and payments. This aggregate information is also useful for managing an insurers’ activities; financial reports are commonly created at least annually and oftentimes quarterly. At any given financial reporting date, information about recent policies and claims will be ongoing and necessarily incomplete; this section introduces concepts for projecting risk information so that it is usful for ratemaking purposes. Information about the risks, such as exposures, premium, claim counts, losses, and rating factors, is typically organized into three databases: policy database - contains information about the risk being insured, the policyholder, and the contract provisions claims database - contains information about each claim; these are linked to the policy database. payment database - contains information on each claims transaction, typically payments but may also changes to case reserves. These are linked to the claims database. With these detailed databases, it is straightforward (in principle) to sum up policy level detail to aggregate information needed for financial reports. This section describes various summary measures commonly used. 7.5.1 Exposures and Premiums A financial reporting period is a length of time that is fixed in the calendar; we use January 1 to December 31 for the examples in this book although other reporting periods are also common. The reporting period is fixed but policies may begin at any time during the year. Even if all policies have a common contract length of (say) one year, because of the differing starting time, they can end at any time during the financial reporting. Figure 7.1 presents four illustrative policies. Because of these differing starting and end times, there needs to be some standards as to what types of measures are most useful for summarizing experience in a given reporting period. Figure 7.1: Timeline of Exposures for Four 12-Month Policies. Some commonly used exposure measures are: written exposuresExposure is based off policies written/issued, the amount of exposures on policies issued (underwritten or written) during the period in question, earned exposuresExposure is based off amount exposed to loss for which coverage has been provided, the exposure units actually exposed to loss during the period, that is, where coverage has already been provided unearned exposuresExposure amount for which coverage has not yet been provided, represent the portion of the written exposures for which coverage has not yet been provided as of that point in time, and in force exposuresExposure amount subject to loss at a particular point in time, exposure units exposed to loss at a given point in time. Table 7.12 gives detailed illustrative calculations for the four illustrative policies. \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{cl|cc|cc|cc|c} \\hline &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;&amp;\\text{In-Force} \\\\ &amp;\\text{Effective} &amp; \\text{Written}&amp; \\text{Exposure} &amp; \\text{Earned} &amp;\\text{Exposure}&amp; \\text{Unearned} &amp;\\text{Exposure}&amp; \\text{Exposure} \\\\ {Policy} &amp;\\text{Date} &amp; 2019 &amp; 2020 &amp; 2019 &amp; 2020 &amp; 2019 &amp; 2020 &amp; \\text{1 Jan 2020} \\\\ \\hline \\text{A}&amp;\\text{1 Jan 2019} &amp; 1.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 1.00 &amp; 0.00&amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.00 \\\\ \\text{B}&amp;\\text{1 April 2019} &amp; 1.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.75 &amp; 0.25 &amp; 0.25 &amp; 0.00&amp; 1.00 \\\\ \\text{C}&amp;\\text{1 July 2019} &amp; 1.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.50 &amp; 0.50 &amp; 0.50 &amp; 0.00&amp; 1.00 \\\\ \\text{D}&amp;\\text{1 Oct 2019} &amp; 1.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.25 &amp; 0.75 &amp; 0.75 &amp; 0.00&amp; 1.00 \\\\ \\hline &amp; Total &amp; 4.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 2.50 &amp; 1.50 &amp; 1.50 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 3.00 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 7.12: Exposures for Four 12-Month Policies This summarization is sometimes known as the calendar year methodExperience for rating is aggregated based on calendar year, as opposed to other methods such as when a policy term began of aggregation to serve as a contrast to the policy yearThis is the period between a policy’s anniversary dates. method. In the latter method, all policies start at the beginning of the year. This method is useful for ratemaking methods based on individual contracts and we do not pursue this further here. In the same way as exposures, one can summarizes premiums. Premiums, like exposures, can be either written, earned, unearned, or in force. Consider the following example. Example. 7.5.1. CAS Exam 5, 2003, Number 10. A 12-month policy is written on March 1, 2002 for a premium of $900.

Thus, earned premium at Dec 31, 2002, equals \\(\\$900 \\times 10/12 = \\$750\\). Answer E. 7.5.2 Losses, Claims, and Payments Broadly speaking, the terms lossThe amount of damages sustained by an individual or corporation, typically as the result of an insurable event. and claimThe amount paid to an individual or corporation for the recovery, under a policy of insurance, for loss that comes within that policy. refer to the amount of compensation paid or potentially payable to the claimant under the terms of the insurance policy. Definitions can vary: Sometimes, the term claim is used interchangeably with the term loss. In some insurance and actuarial sources, the term loss is used for the amount of damage sustained in an insured event. The claim is the amount paid by the insurer with differences typically due to deductibles, upper policy limits, and the like. In economic usages, a claim is a demand for payment by an insured or by an injured third-party under the terms and conditions of insurance contract and the loss is the amount paid by the insurer. This text will follow the second bullet. However, when reading other sources, you will need to take care when thinking about definitions for the terms loss and claim. To establish additional terminology, it is helpful to follow the timeline of a claim as it develops. In Figure 7.2, the claim occurs at time \\(t_1\\) and the insuring company is notified at time \\(t_3\\). There can be a long gap between occurrence and notification such that the end of a company financial reporting period, known as a valuation dateA valuation date is the date at which a company summarizes its financial position, typically quarterly or annually., occurs (\\(t_2\\)). In this case, the claim is said to be incurred but not reportedA claim is said to be incurred but not reported if the insured event occurs prior to a valuation date (and hence the insurer is liable for payment) but the event has not been reported to the insurer. at this valuation date. After claim notification, there may one or more loss payments. Not all of the payments may be made by the next valuation date (\\(t_4\\)). As the claim develops, eventually the company deems its financial obligations on the claim to be resolved and declares the claim closedA claim is said to be closed when the company deems its financial obligations on the claim to be resolved.. However, it is possible that new facts arise and the claim must be re-opened, giving rise to additional loss payments prior to being closed again. Figure 7.2: Timeline of Claim Development. Accident dateDate of loss occurrence that gives rise to a claim - the date of the occurrence which gave rise to the claim. This is also known as the date of loss or the occurrence date. Report dateDate when insurer is notified of the claim - the date the insurer receives notice of the claim. Claims not currently known by the insurer are referred to as unreported claims or incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. Until the claim is settled, the reported claim is considered an open claimA claim that has been reported but not yet closed. Once the claim is settled, it is categorized as a closed claim. In some instances, further activity may occur after the claim is closed, and the claim may be re-opened. Recall that a loss is the amount paid or payable to claimants under the terms of insurance policies. Further, we have Paid losses are those losses for a particular period that have actually been paid to claimants. Where there is an expectation that payment will be made in the future, a claim will have an associated case reserve representing the estimated amount of that payment. Reported Losses, also known as case incurred, is Paid Losses + Case Reserves The ultimate loss is the amount of money required to close and settle all claims for a defined group of policies. 7.5.3 Comparing Pure Premium and Loss Ratio Methods Now that we have learned how exposures, premiums, and claims develop over time, we can consider how they can be used for ratemaking. We have seen that insurers offer many different types of policies that cover different policyholders and amounts of risks. This aggregation is sometimes loosely referred to as the mix of businessDifferent types of policies in an insurer’s portfolio. Importantly, the mix changes over time as policyholders come and go, amounts of risks change, and so forth. The exposures, premiums, and types of risks from a prior financial reporting may not be representative of the period that rates are being developed for. The process of extrapolating exposures, premiums, and risk types is known as trending. For example, an on-level earned premiumEarned premium of historical policies using the current rate structure is that earned premium that would have resulted for the experience period had the current rates been in effect for the entire period. Most trending methods used in practice are mathematically straight-forward although they can become complicated given contractual and administrative complexities. We refer the reader to standard references that describe approaches in detail such as Werner and Modlin (2016) and Friedland (2013). Loss Ratio Method The expression for the loss ratio method indicated change factor in equation (7.3) assumes a certain amount of consistency in the portfolio experience over time. For another approach, we can define the experience loss ratioRatio of experience loss to on-level earned premium in the experience period to be: \\[ \\small{ LR_{experience} = \\frac{\\text{experience losses}}{\\text{experience period earned exposure}\\times \\text{current rate}} . } \\] Here, we think of the experience period earned exposure \\(\\times\\) current rate as the experience premium. Using equation (7.2), we can write a loss ratio as \\[ \\small{ LR = \\frac{\\text{Losses}}{\\text{Premium}}=\\frac{1-V-Q}{\\text{(Losses + Fixed)}/\\text{Losses}}=\\frac{1-V-Q}{1+G} ~, } \\] where \\(G = \\text{Fixed} / \\text{Losses}\\), the ratio of fixed expenses to premiums. With this expression, we define the target loss ratio \\[ \\small{ LR_{target} = \\frac{1-V-Q}{1+G} = \\frac{1-\\text{premium related expense factor - profit and contingencies factor}} {1+\\text{ratio of non-premium related expenses to losses}} . } \\] With these, the indicated change factor is \\[\\begin{equation} \\small{ ICF =\\frac{LR_{experience}}{LR_{target}}. } \\tag{7.4} \\end{equation}\\] Comparing equation (7.3) to (7.4), we see that the latter offers more flexibility to explicitly incorporate trended experience. As the loss ratio method is based on rate changes, this flexibility is certainly warranted. Comparison of Methods Assuming that exposures, premiums, and claims have been trended to be representative of a period that rates are being developed for, we are now in a position to compare the pure premium and loss ratio methods for ratemaking. We start with the observation that for the same data inputs, these two approaches produce the same results. That is, they are algebraically equivalent. However, the rely on different inputs: \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|l}\\hline \\text{Pure Premium Method} &amp; \\text{Loss Ratio Method} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Based on exposures} &amp; \\text{Based on premiums} \\\\ \\text{Does not require existing rates} &amp; \\text{Requires existing rates} \\\\ \\text{Does not use on-level premiums} &amp; \\text{Uses on-level premiums} \\\\ \\text{Produces indicated rates} &amp; \\text{Produces indicated rate changes} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Comparing the pure premium and loss ratio methods, we note that: The pure premium method requires well-defined, responsive exposures. The loss ratio method cannot be used for new business because it produces indicated rate changes. The pure premium method is preferable where on-level premium is difficult to calculate. In some instances, such as commercial lines where individual risk rating adjustments are made to individual policies, it is difficult to determine the on-level earned premium required for the loss ratio method. In many developed countries like the US where lines of business have been in existence, the loss ratio approach is more popular. Example. 7.5.2. CAS Exam 5, 2006, Number 36. You are given the following information: Experience period on-level earned premium = $500,000 Experience period trended and developed losses = $300,000 Experience period earned exposure = 10,000 Premium-related expenses factor = 23% Non-premium related expenses = $21,000 Profit and contingency factor = 5% Calculate the indicated rate level change using the loss ratio method. Calculate the indicated rate level change using the pure premium method. Describe one situation in which it is preferable to use the loss ratio method, and one situation in which it is preferable to use the pure premium method. Show Example Solution We will calculate the experience and target loss ratios, then take the ratio to get the indicated rate change. The experience loss ratio is \\[ \\small{ LR_{experience} = \\frac{\\text{experience losses}}{\\text{experience period premium}} =\\frac{300000}{500000} = 0.60. } \\] The target loss ratio is: \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} LR_{target} &amp;= \\frac{1-V-Q}{1+G} = \\frac{1-\\text{premium related expense factor - profit and contingencies factor}} {1+\\text{ratio of non-premium related expenses to losses}}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1-0.23 - 0.05}{1+0.07} = 0.673 . \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Here, the ratio of non-premium related expenses to losses is \\(G = \\frac{21000}{300000} = 0.07\\). Thus, the (new) indicated rate level change is \\[ \\small{ ICF =\\frac{LR_{experience}}{LR_{target}} -1 = \\frac{0.60}{0.673} -1 = -10.8\\%. } \\] (b) Using the pure premium method, the indicated change factor, \\(ICF\\), is \\[ \\small{ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} ICF &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Losses + Fixed}}{\\text{Premium} \\times (1 - Q - V)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{300000+ 21000}{500000 \\times (1 - 0.23 - 0.05)} = 0.892 . \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Thus, the indicated rate level change is \\(0.892 -1 = -10.8\\%\\). The loss ratio method is preferable when the exposure unit is not available. The loss ratio method is preferable when the exposure unit is not reasonably consistent between risks. The pure premium method is preferable for a new line of business. The pure premium method is preferable where on-level premiums are difficult to calculate. 7.6 Selecting a Premium In this section, you learn how to: Describe skewed distributions via a Lorenz curve and Gini index Define a concentration curve and the corresponding Gini statistic Use the concentration curve and Gini statistic for premium selection base on out-of-sample validation For a portfolio of insurance contracts, insurers collect premiums and pay out losses. After making adjustments for expenses and profit considerations, tools for comparing distributions of premiums and losses can be helpful when selecting a premium calculation principle. 7.6.1 Classic Lorenz Curve In welfare economics, it is common to compare distributions via the Lorenz curveA graph of the proportion of a population on the horizontal axis and a distribution function of interest on the vertical axis., developed by Max Otto Lorenz (Lorenz 1905). A Lorenz curve is a graph of the proportion of a population on the horizontal axis and a distribution function of interest on the vertical axis. It is typically used to represent income distributions. When the income distribution is perfectly aligned with the population distribution, the Lorenz curve results in a 45 degree line that is known as the line of equality45 degree line equating x and y, that represents a perfect alignment in the sample and population distribution. Because the graph compares two distribution functions, one can also think of a Lorenz curve as a type of pp plotStatistical plot used to assess how close a data sample matches a theorized distribution that was introduced in Section 4.1.2.1. The area between the Lorenz curve and the line of equality is a measure of the discrepancy between the income and population distributions. Two times this area is known as the Gini indexThe gini index is twice the area between a lorenz curve and a 45 degree line., introduced by Corrado Gini in 1912. Example – Classic Lorenz Curve. For an insurance example, Figure 7.3 shows a distribution of insurance losses. This figure is based on a random sample of 2000 losses. The left-hand panel shows a right-skewed histogram of losses. The right-hand panel provides the corresponding Lorenz curve, showing again a skewed distribution. For example, the arrow marks the point where 60 percent of the policyholders have 30 percent of losses. The 45 degree line is the line of equality; if each policyholder has the same loss, then the loss distribution would be at this line. The Gini index, twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the 45 degree line, is 37.6 percent for this data set. Figure 7.3: Distribution of Insurance Losses. The left-hand panel is a density plot of losses. The right-hand panel presents the same data using a Lorenz curve. 7.6.2 Performance Curve and a Gini Statistic We now introduce a modification of the classic Lorenz curve and Gini statistic that is useful in insurance applications. Specifically, we introduce a performance curveA concentration curve is a graph of the distribution of two variables, where both variables are ordered by only one of variables. for insurance applications, it is a graph of distribution of losses versus premiums, where both losses and premiums are ordered by premiums. that, in this case, is a graph of the distribution of losses versus premiums, where both losses and premiums are ordered by premiums. To make the ideas concrete, we provide some notation and consider \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\) policies. For the \\(i\\)th policy, let \\(y_i\\) denote the insurance loss, \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) be a set of rating variables known to the analyst, and \\(P_i=P(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) be the associated premium that is a function of \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\). The set of information used to calculate the performance curve for the \\(i\\)th policy is \\((y_i, P_i)\\). Performance Curve It is convenient to first sort the set of policies based on premiums (from smallest to largest) and then compute the premium and loss distributions. The premium distribution is \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{F}_P(s) = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n P_i ~\\mathrm{I}(P_i \\leq s) }{\\sum_{i=1}^n P_i} , \\tag{7.5} \\end{equation}\\] and the loss distribution is \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{F}_{L}(s) = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i ~\\mathrm{I}(P_i \\leq s) }{\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i} , \\tag{7.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathrm{I}(\\cdot)\\) is the indicator function, returning a 1 if the event is true and zero otherwise. For a given value \\(s\\), \\(\\hat{F}_P(s)\\) gives the proportion of premiums less than or equal to \\(s\\), and \\(\\hat{F}_{L}(s)\\) gives the proportion of losses for those policyholders with premiums less than or equal to \\(s\\). The graph \\(\\left(\\hat{F}_P(s),\\hat{F}_{L}(s) \\right)\\) is known as a performance curve. Example – Loss Distribution. Suppose we have \\(n=5\\) policyholders with experience as follows. The data have been ordered by premiums. Variable \\(i\\) 1 2 3 4 5 Premium \\(P(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) 2 4 5 7 16 Cumulative Premiums \\(\\sum_{j=1}^i P(\\mathbf{x}_j)\\) 2 6 11 18 34 Loss \\(y_i\\) 2 5 6 6 17 Cumulative Loss \\(\\sum_{j=1}^i y_j\\) 2 7 13 19 36 Figure 7.4 compares the Lorenz to the performance curve. The left-hand panel shows the Lorenz curve. The horizontal axis is the cumulative proportion of policyholders (0, 0.2, 0.4, and so forth) and the vertical axis is the cumulative proportion of losses (0, 2/36, 7/36, and so forth). For the Lorenz curve, you first order by the loss size (which turns out to be the same order as premiums for this simple dataset). This figure shows a large separation between the distributions of losses and policyholders. The right-hand panel shows the performance curve. Because observations are sorted by premiums, the first point after the origin (reading from left to right) is (2/34, 2/36). The second point is (6/34, 7/36), with the pattern continuing. From the figure, we see that there is little separation between losses and premiums. Figure 7.4: Lorenz versus Performance Curve The performance curve can be helpful to the analyst who thinks about forming profitable portfolios for the insurer. For example, suppose that \\(s\\) is chosen to represent the 95th percentile of the premium distribution. Then, the horizontal axis, \\(\\hat{F}_P(s)\\), represents the fraction of premiums for this portfolio and the vertical axis, \\(\\hat{F}_L(s)\\), the fraction of losses for this portfolio. When developing premium principles, analysts wish to avoid unprofitable situations and make profits, or at least break even. The expectation of the numerator in equation (7.6) is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{E}~ y_i=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mu_i\\). Thus, if the premium principle is chosen such that \\(P_i= \\mu_i\\), then we anticipate a close relation between the premium and loss distributions, resulting in a 45 degree line. The 45 degree line presents equality between losses and premiums, a break-even situation which is the benchmark for insurance pricing. Gini Statistic The classic Lorenz curve shows the proportion of policyholders on the horizontal axis and the loss distribution function on the vertical axis. The performance curve extends the classical Lorenz curve in two ways, (1) through the ordering of risks and prices by prices and (2) by allowing prices to vary by observation. We summarize the performance curve in the same way as the classic Lorenz curve using a Gini statistic, defined as twice the area between the curve and a 45 degree line. The analyst seeks ordered performance curves that approach passing through the 45 degree line; these have least separation between the loss and premium distributions and therefore small Gini statistics. Specifically, the Gini statistic can be calculated as follows. Suppose that the empirical performance curve is given by \\(\\{ (a_0=0, b_0=0), (a_1, b_1), \\ldots,\\) \\((a_n=1, b_n=1) \\}\\) for a sample of \\(n\\) observations. Here, we use \\(a_j = \\hat{F}_P(P_j)\\) and \\(b_j = \\hat{F}_{L}(P_j)\\). Then, the empirical Gini statistic is \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\widehat{Gini} &amp;=&amp; 2\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (a_{j+1} - a_j) \\left \\{ \\frac{a_{j+1}+a_j}{2} - \\frac{b_{j+1}+b_j}{2} \\right\\} \\nonumber \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1 - \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (a_{j+1} - a_j) (b_{j+1}+b_j) . \\tag{7.7} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Show Gini Formula Details To understand the formula for the Gini statistic, here is a sketch of a parallelogram connecting points \\((a_1, b_1)\\), \\((a_2, b_2)\\), and a 45 degree line. You can use basic geometry to check that the area of the figure is \\(Area = (a_2 - a_1) \\left \\{\\frac{a_2+a_1}{2} - \\frac{b_2+b_1}{2} \\right\\}\\). The definition of the Gini statistic in equation (7.7) is simply twice the sum of the parallelograms. The second equality in equation (7.7) is the result of some straight-forward algebra. Example – Loss Distribution: Continued. The Gini statistic for the Lorenz curve (left-hand panel of Figure 7.4) is 34.4 percent. In contrast, the Gini statistic for performance curve (right-hand panel) is 1.7 percent. 7.6.3 Out-of-Sample Validation The benefits of out-of-sample validation for model selection were introduced in Section 4.2. We now demonstrate the use of the a Gini statistic and performance curve in this context. The procedure follows: Use an in-sample data set to estimate several competing models, each producing a premium function. Designate an out-of-sample, or validation, data set of the form \\(\\{(y_i, \\mathbf{x}_i), i=1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Use the explanatory variables from the validation sample to form premiums of the form \\(P(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\). Compute the Gini statistic for each model. Choose the model with the lowest Gini statistic. Example – Community Rating versus Premiums that Vary by State. Suppose that we have experience from 25 states and that, for each state, we have available 200 observations that can be used to predict future losses. For simplicity, assume that the analyst knows that these losses were generated by a gamma distribution with a common shape parameter equal to 5. Unknown to the analyst, the scale parameters vary by state, from a low of 20 to 66. To compute base premiums, the analyst assumes a scale parameter that is common to all states that is to be estimated from the data. You can think of this common premium as based on a community ratingThis generally refers to the premium principle where all risks pay the same amount. principle. As an alternative, the analyst allows the scale parameters to vary by state and will again use the data to estimate these parameters. An out of sample validation set of 100 losses from each state is available. For each of the two rating procedures, determine the performance curve and the corresponding Gini statistic. Choose the rate procedure with the lower Gini statistic. Show Example Solution Recall for the gamma distribution that the mean equals the shape times the scale or, 5 times the scale parameter, for our example. So, you can check that the maximum likelihood estimates are simply the average experience. For our base premium, we assume a common distribution among all states. For these simulated data, the average in-sample loss is \\(P_1\\)=221.36. As an alternative, we use averages that are state-specific; these averages form our premiums \\(P_2\\). Because this illustration uses means that vary by states, we anticipate this alternative rating procedure to be preferred to the community rating procedure. Out of sample claims were generated from the same gamma distribution as the in-sample model, with 100 observations for each state. The following R code shows how to calculate the performance curves. y &lt;- Outy P1 &lt;- Flatpred P2 &lt;- Predvec n1 = length(y) XYmat = data.frame(cbind(y,P1,P2)) XYmatPOrder = XYmat[order(P1),] # Sort by premiums P1 DFy1 = c(0,cumsum(XYmatPOrder$y)/sum(y)) DFx1 = c(0,cumsum(XYmatPOrder$P1)/sum(P1)) XYmatPOrder = XYmat[order(P2),] # Sort by premiums P2 DFy2 = c(0,cumsum(XYmatPOrder$y)/sum(y)) DFx2 = c(0,cumsum(XYmatPOrder$P2)/sum(P2)) # FIGURE 3 par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) # Lorenz Curve plot(DFx1,DFy1,xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1), type=&quot;b&quot;, cex= 0.2, xlab=&quot;Premium Distn&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;, main=&quot;Flat&quot;);abline(0,1) mtext(&quot;Loss Distn&quot;, side=2, line=-0.5, at=1.1, las=1, cex=1.0) # Performance Curve plot(DFx2,DFy2,xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1), type=&quot;b&quot;, cex= 0.2, xlab=&quot;Premium Distn&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;, main=&quot;State Specific&quot;);abline(0,1) mtext(&quot;Loss Distn&quot;, side=2, line=-0.5, at=1.1, las=1, cex=1.0) For these data, the Gini statistics are 19.6 percent for the flat rate premium and -0.702 percent for the state-specific alternative. This indicates that the state-specific alternative procedure is strongly preferred to the base community rating procedure. Discussion In insurance claims modeling, standard out-of-sample validation measures are not the most informative due to the high proportions of zeros (corresponding to no claim) and the skewed fat-tailed distribution of the positive values. In contrast, the Gini statistic works well with many zeros (see the demonstration in (Frees, Meyers, and Cummings 2014)). The value of the performance curves and Gini statistics have been recently advanced in the paper of Denuit, Sznajder, and Trufin (2019). Properties of an extended version, dealing with relatives for new premiums, were developed by Frees, Meyers, and Cummings (2011) and Frees, Meyers, and Cummings (2014). In these articles you can find formulas for the standard errors and additional background information. 7.7 Further Resources and Contributors This chapter serves as a bridge between the technical introduction of this book and an introduction to pricing and ratemaking for practicing actuaries. For readers interested in learn practical aspects of pricing, we recommend introductions by the Society of Actuaries in Friedland (2013) and by the Casualty Actuarial Society in Werner and Modlin (2016). For a classic risk management introduction to pricing, see Niehaus and Harrington (2003). See also Finger (2006) and Frees (2014). Bühlmann (1985) was the first in the academic literature to argue that pricing should be done first at the portfolio level (he referred to this as a top down approach) which would be subsequently reconciled with pricing of individual contracts. See also the discussion in Kaas et al. (2008), Chapter 5. For more background on pricing principles, a classic treatment is by Gerber (1979) with a more modern approach in Kaas et al. (2008). For more discussion of a pricing from a financial economics viewpoint, see Bauer, Phillips, and Zanjani (2013). Edward W.

Rate Regulation Insurance regulation helps to ensure the financial stability of insurers and to protect consumers. Insurers receive premiums in return for promises to pay in the event of a contingent (insured) event. Like other financial institutions such as banks, there is a strong public interest in promoting the continuing viability of insurers. Market Conduct To help protect consumers, regulators impose administrative rules on the behavior of market participants. These rules, known as market conduct regulationRegulation that ensures consumers obtain fair and reasonable insurance prices and coverage, provide systems of regulatory controls that require insurers to demonstrate that they are providing fair and reliable services, including rating, in accordance with the statutes and regulations of a jurisdiction. Product regulation serves to protect consumers by ensuring that insurance policy provisions are reasonable and fair, and do not contain major gaps in coverage that might be misunderstood by consumers and leave them unprotected. The insurance product is the insurance contract (policy) and the coverage it provides. Insurance contracts are regulated for these reasons: Insurance policies are complex legal documents that are often difficult to interpret and understand. Insurers write insurance policies and sell them to the public on a “take it or leave it” basis. Market conduct includes rules for intermediaries such as agents (who sell insurance to individuals) and brokers (who sell insurance to businesses). Market conduct also includes competition policy regulation, designed to ensure an efficient and competitive marketplace that offers low prices to consumers. Rate Regulation Rate regulation helps guide the development of premiums and so is the focus of this chapter. As with other aspects of market conduct regulation, the intent of these regulations is to ensure that insurers not take unfair advantage of consumers. Rate (and policy form) regulation is common worldwide. The amount of regulatory scrutiny varies by insurance product. Rate regulation is uncommon in life insurance. Further, in non-life insurance, most commercial lines and reinsurance are free from regulation. Rate regulation is common in automobile insurance, health insurance, workers compensation, medical malpractice, and homeowners insurance. These are markets in which insurance is mandatory or in which universal coverage is thought to be socially desirable. There are three principles that guide rate regulation: rates should be adequate (to maintain insurance company solvency), but not excessive (not so high as to lead to exorbitant profits), nor unfairly discriminatory (price differences must reflect expected claim and expense differences). Recently, in auto and home insurance, the twin issues of availability and affordability, which are not explicitly included in the guiding principles, have been assuming greater importance in regulatory decisions. Rates are Not Unfairly Discriminatory Some government regulations of insurance restrict the amount, or level, of premium rates. These are based on the first two of the three guiding rate regulation principles, that rates be adequate but not excessive. This type of regulation is discussed further in the following section on types of rate regulation. Other government regulations restrict the type of information that can be used in risk classification. These are based on the third guiding principle, that rates not be unfairly discriminatory. “Discrimination” in an insurance context has a different meaning than commonly used; for our purposes, discrimination means the ability to distinguish among things or, in our case, policyholders. The real issue is what is meant by the adjective “fair.” In life insurance, it has long been held that it is reasonable and fair to charge different premium rates by age. For example, a life insurance premium differs dramatically between an 80 year old and someone aged 20. In contrast, it is unheard of to use rates that differ by: ethnicity/race, political affiliation, or religion. It is not a matter of whether data can be used to establish statistical significance among the levels of any of these variables. Rather, it is a societal decision as to what constitutes notions of “fairness.” Different jurisdictions have taken different stances on what constitutes a fair rating variable. For example, in some juridictions for some insurance products, gender is no longer a permissible variable. As an illustration, the European Union now prohibits the use of gender for automobile rating. As another example, in the U.S., many discussions have revolved around the use of credit ratings to be used in automobile insurance pricing. Credit ratings are designed to measure consumer financial reponsibility. Yet, some argue that credit rates are good proxies for ethnicity and hence should be prohibited. In an age where more data is being used in imaginative ways, discussions of what constitutes a fair rating variable will only become more important going forward and much of that discussion is beyond the scope of this text. However, it is relevant to the discussion to remark that actuaries and other data analysts can contribute to societal discussions on what constitutes a “fair” rating variable in unique ways by establishing the magnitude of price differences when using variables under discussion. Types of Rate Regulation There are several methods, that vary by the level of scrutiny, by which regulators may restrict the rates that insurers offer. The most restrictive is a government prescribedGovernment sets the entire rating system including coverages regulatory system, where the government regulator determines and promulgates the rates, classifications, forms, and so forth, to which all insurers must adhere. Also restrictive are prior approvalRegulator must approve rates, forms, rules filed by insurers before use systems. Here, the insurer must file rates, rules, and so forth, with government regulators. Depending on the statute, the filing becomes effective when a specified waiting period elapses (if the government regulator does not take specific action on the filing, it is deemed approved automatically) or when the government regulator formally approves the filing. The least restrictive is a no fileInsurers may use new rates, forms, rules without approval from regulators or record maintenance system where the insurer need not file rates, rules, and so forth, with the government regulator. The regulator may periodically examine the insurer to ensure compliance with the law. Another relatively flexible system is the file onlyInsurers must file rates, forms, rules for record keeping and use immediately system, also known as competitive rating, where the insurer simply keeps files to ensure compliance with the law. In between these two extremes are the (1) file and use, (2) use and file, (3) modified prior approval, and (4) flex rating systems. File and Use: The insurer must file rates, rules, and so forth, with the government regulator. The filing becomes effective immediately or on a future date specified by the filer. Use and File: The filing becomes effective when used. The insurer must file rates, rules, and so forth, with the government regulator within a specified time period after first use. Modified Prior Approval: This is a hybrid of “prior approval” and “file and use” laws. If the rate revision is based solely on a change in loss experience then “file and use” may apply. However, if the rate revision is based on a change in expense relationships or rate classifications, then “prior approval” may apply. Flex (or Band) Rating: The insurer may increase or decrease a rate within a “flex band,” or range, without approval of the government regulator. Generally, either “file and use” or “use and file” provisions apply. For a broad introduction to government insurance regulation from a global perspective, see the website of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Bibliography "],

This chapter motivates the use of risk classification in insurance pricing and introduces readers to the Poisson regression as a prominent example of risk classification. In Section 8.1 we explain why insurers need to incorporate various risk characteristics, or rating factors, of individual policyholders in pricing insurance contracts. We then introduce Section 8.2 the Poisson regression as a pricing tool to achieve such premium differentials. The concept of exposure is also introduced in this section. As most rating factors are categorical, we show in Section 8.3 how the multiplicative tariff model can be incorporated in the Poisson regression model in practice, along with numerical examples for illustration. 8.1 Introduction In this section, you learn: Why premiums should vary across policyholders with different risk characteristics. The meaning of the adverse selection spiral. The need for risk classification. Through insurance contracts, the policyholders effectively transfer their risks to the insurer in exchange for premiums. For the insurer to stay in business, the premium income collected from a pool of policyholders must at least equal the benefit outgo. In general insurance products where a premium is charged for a single period, say annual, the gross insurance premiumSum of expected losses and expenses and profit on a policy based on the equivalence principle is stated as \\[ \\text{Gross Premium = Expected Losses + Expected Expenses + Profit}. \\] Thus, ignoring the frictional expenses associated with the administrative expenses and the profit, the net or pure premium charged by the insurer should be equal to the expected losses occurring from the risk that is transferred from the policyholder. If all policyholders in the insurance pool have identical risk profiles, the insurer simply charges the same premium for all policyholders because they have the same expected loss. In reality, however, the policyholders are hardly homogeneous. For example, mortality risk in life insurance depends on the characteristics of the policyholder, such as, age, sex and life style. In auto insurance, those characteristics may include age, occupation, the type or use of the car, and the area where the driver resides. The knowledge of these characteristics or variables can enhance the ability of calculating fair premiums for individual policyholders, as they can be used to estimate or predict the expected losses more accurately. Adverse Selection. Indeed, if the insurer does not differentiate the risk characteristicsThe distinguishing features of a policy that help determine the expected loss on the policy of individual policyholders and simply charges the same premium to all insureds based on the average loss in the portfolio, the insurer would face adverse selectionA pricing structure that entices riskier individuals to purchase and discourages low-risk individuals from purchasing, a situation where individuals with a higher chance of loss are attracted in the portfolio and low-risk individuals are repelled. For example, consider a health insurance industry where smoking status is an important risk factor for mortality and morbidity. Most health insurers in the market require different premiums depending on smoking status, so smokers pay higher premiums than non-smokers, with other characteristics being identical. Now suppose that there is an insurer, we will call EquitabAll, that offers the same premium to all insureds regardless of smoking status, unlike other competitors. The net premium of EquitabAll is naturally an average mortality loss accounting for both smokers and non-smokers. That is, the net premium is a weighted average of the losses with the weights being the proportion of smokers and non-smokers, respectively. Thus it is easy to see that that a smoker would have a good incentive to purchase insurance from EquitabAll than from other insurers as the offered premium by EquitabAll is relatively lower. At the same time non-smokers would prefer buying insurance from somewhere else where lower premiums, computed from the non-smoker group only, are offered. As a result, there will be more smokers and less non-smokers in the EquitabAll’s portfolio, which leads to larger-than-expected losses and hence a higher premium for insureds in the next period to cover the higher costs. With the raised new premium in the next period, non-smokers in EquitabAll will have even greater incentives to switch the insurer. As this cycle continues over time, EquitabAll would gradually retain more smokers and less non-smokers in its portfolio with the premium continually raised, eventually leading to a collapsing of business. In the literature, this phenomenon is known as the adverse selection spiralPhenomenon where a book of business deteriorates as it attracts ever-riskier individuals when forced to increase premiums due to losses or death spiral. Therefore, incorporating and differentiating important risk characteristics of individuals in the insurance pricing process are a pertinent component for both the determination of fair premium for individual policyholders and the long term sustainability of insurers. Rating Factors. In order to incorporate relevant risk characteristics of policyholders in the pricing process, insurers maintain some classification system that assigns each policyholder to one of the risk classes based on a relatively small number of risk characteristics that are deemed most relevant. These characteristics used in the classification system are called the rating factorsCharacteristics of a risk that help price the insurance contract, which are a priori variablesVariables which the insurer has prior knowledge of before the policy inception in the sense that they are known before the contract begins (e.g., sex, health status, vehicle type, etc, are known during the underwriting). All policyholders sharing identical risk factors thus are assigned to the same risk class, and are considered homogeneous from the pricing viewpoint; the insurer consequently charge them the same premium or rate. Regarding the risk factors and premiums, the Actuarial Standard of Practice (ASOP No. 12) of the Actuarial Standards Board (2018) states that the actuary should select risk characteristics that are related to expected outcomes, and that rates within a risk classification system would be considered equitable if differences in rates reflect material differences in expected cost for risk characteristics. In the process of choosing risk factors, ASOP also requires the actuary to consider the following: relationship of risk characteristics and expected outcomes, causality, objectivity, practicality, applicable law, industry practices, and business practices. Technical Supplement TS 8.B provides additional discussion of selection of rating factors. On the quantitative side, an important task for the actuary in building any risk classification is to construct a statistical model that can determine the expected loss given various rating factors of a policyholder. The standard approach is to adopt a regression model which produces the expected loss as the output when the relevant risk factors are given as the inputs. In this chapter we learn the Poisson regression, which can be used when the loss is a count variableA count variable is a discrete variable with values on nonnegative integers., as a prominent example of an insurance pricing tool. Show Quiz Solution 8.2 Poisson Regression Model The Poisson regression model has been successfully used in a wide range of applications and has an advantage of allowing closed-form expressionsA mathematical expression that can be well defined with a formula that has a finite number of operations for important quantities, which provides a informative intuition and interpretation. In this section we introduce the Poisson regression as a natural extension of the Poisson distribution. In this section you will: Understand Poisson regressions as convenient tool to combine individual Poisson distributions in a unified fashion. Learn the concept of exposure and its importance. Formally learn how to formulate the Poisson regression model using indicator variables when the explanatory variables are categorical. 8.2.1 Need for Poisson Regression Poisson Distribution To introduce the Poisson regression, let us consider a hypothetical health insurance portfolio where all policyholders are of the same age and only one risk factor, smoking status, is relevant. Smoking status thus is a categorical variableA variable whose values are qualitative groups and can have no natural ordering (nominal) or an ordering (ordinal) containing two different types: smoker and non-smoker. In the statistical literature different types in a given categorical variable are commonly called levelsDifferent outcomes of a categorical variable. As there are two levels for the smoking status, we may denote smoker and non-smoker by level 1 and 2, respectively. Here the numbering is arbitrary and nominalA categorical variable where the categories do not have a natural order and any numbering is arbitrary. Suppose now that we are interested in pricing a health insurance where the premium for each policyholder is determined by the number of outpatient visits to doctor’s office during a year. The amount of medical cost for each visit is assumed to be the same regardless of the smoking status for simplicity. Thus if we believe that smoking status is a valid risk factor in this health insurance, it is natural to consider the data separately for each smoking status. In Table 8.1 we present the data for this portfolio. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{cc|cc|cc} \\hline \\text{Smoker} &amp; \\text{(level 1)} &amp; \\text{Non-smoker}&amp;\\text{(level 2)} &amp; &amp; \\text{Both}\\\\ \\text{Count} &amp; \\text{Observed} &amp; \\text{Count} &amp; \\text{Observed} &amp; \\text{Count} &amp; \\text{Observed} \\\\ \\hline 0 &amp; 2213 &amp; 0 &amp; 6671 &amp; 0 &amp; 8884 \\\\ 1 &amp; 178 &amp; 1 &amp; 430 &amp; 1 &amp; 608 \\\\ 2 &amp; 11 &amp; 2 &amp; 25 &amp; 2 &amp; 36 \\\\ 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 3 &amp; 15 \\\\ 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 \\\\ 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; 2409 &amp; \\text{Total} &amp; 7141 &amp; \\text{Total} &amp; 9550 \\\\ \\text{Mean} &amp; 0.0926 &amp; \\text{Mean} &amp; 0.0746 &amp; \\text{Mean} &amp; 0.0792 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 8.1 : Number of visits to doctor’s office in last year As this dataset contains random counts, we try to fit a Poisson distribution for each level. As introduced in Section 2.2.3.2, the probability mass function of the Poisson with mean \\(\\mu\\) is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr(Y=y)=\\frac{\\mu^y e^{-\\mu}}{y!},\\qquad y=0,1,2, \\ldots \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] and \\(\\mathrm{E~}{(Y)}=\\mathrm{Var~}{(Y)}=\\mu\\). In regression contexts, it is common to use \\(\\mu\\) for mean parameters instead of the Poisson parameter \\(\\lambda\\) although certainly both symbols are suitable. As we saw in Section 2.4, the mleMaximum likelihood estimate of the Poisson distribution is given by the sample mean. Thus if we denote the Poisson mean parameter for each level by \\(\\mu_{(1)}\\) (smoker) and \\(\\mu_{(2)}\\) (non-smoker), we see from Table 8.1 that \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{(1)}=0.0926\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{(2)}=0.0746\\). This simple example shows the basic idea of risk classification. Depending on the smoking status a policyholder will have a different risk characteristic and it can be incorporated through varying Poisson parameter in computing the fair premium. In this example the ratio of expected loss frequencies is \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{(1)}/\\hat{\\mu}_{(2)}=1.2402\\), implying that smokers tend to visit doctor’s office 24.02\\(\\%\\) times more frequently compared to non-smokers. It is also informative to note that if the insurer charges the same premium to all policyholders regardless of the smoking status, based on the average characteristic of the portfolio, as was the case for EquitabAll described in Introduction, the expected frequency (or the premium) \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) is 0.0792, obtained from the last column of Table 8.1. It is easily verified that \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\mu} = \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_1+n_2}\\right)\\hat{\\mu}_{(1)}+\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1+n_2}\\right)\\hat{\\mu}_{(2)}=0.0792, \\tag{8.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n_i\\) is the number of observations in each level. Clearly, this premium is a weighted average of the premiums for each level with the weight equal to the proportion of the insureds in that level. A simple Poisson regression In the example above, we have fitted a Poisson distribution for each level separately, but we can actually combine them together in a unified fashion so that a single Poisson model can encompass both smoking and non-smoking statuses. This can be done by relating the Poisson mean parameter with the risk factor. In other words, we make the Poisson mean, which is the expected loss frequency, respond to the change in the smoking status. The conventional approach to deal with a categorical variable is to adopt indicator or dummy variablesA variable that takes on a value of 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of a categorical characteristic that take either 1 or 0, so that we turn the switch on for one level and off for others. Therefore we may propose to use \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1 \\tag{8.3} \\end{equation}\\] or, more commonly, a log linear formLinear regression model where the response variable is the natural log of the expected response value \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1, \\tag{8.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(x_1\\) is an indicator variable with \\[\\begin{equation} x_1= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if smoker}, \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\tag{8.5} \\end{equation}\\] We generally prefer the log linear relation (8.4) to the linear one in (8.3) to prevent undesirable events of producing negative \\(\\mu\\) values, which may happen when there are many different risk factors and levels. The setup (8.4) and (8.5) then results in different Poisson frequency parameters depending on the level in the risk factor: \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu= \\begin{cases} \\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_0 \\end{cases} \\quad \\text{or equivalently,}\\qquad \\mu= \\begin{cases} e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1} &amp; \\text{if smoker (level 1)}, \\\\ e^{\\beta_0} &amp; \\text{if non-smoker (level 2)}, \\end{cases} \\tag{8.6} \\end{equation}\\] achieving what we aim for. This is the simplest form of the Poisson regression. Note that we require a single indicator variable to model two levels in this case. Alternatively, it is also possible to use two indicator variables through a different coding scheme. This scheme requires dropping the intercept term so that (8.4) is modified to \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu=\\beta_1 x_1+\\beta_2 x_2, \\tag{8.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(x_2\\) is the second indicator variable with \\[\\begin{equation} x_2= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if non-smoker}, \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\tag{8.8} \\end{equation}\\] Then we have, from (8.7), \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu= \\begin{cases} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\end{cases} \\quad \\text{or}\\qquad \\mu= \\begin{cases} e^{\\beta_1} &amp; \\text{if smoker (level 1)}, \\\\ e^{\\beta_2} &amp; \\text{if non-smoker (level 2)}. \\end{cases} \\tag{8.9} \\end{equation}\\] The numerical result of (8.6) is the same as (8.9) as all the coefficients are given as numbers in actual estimation, with the former setup more common in most texts; we also stick to the former. With this Poisson regression model we can easily understand how the coefficients \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are linked to the expected loss frequency in each level. According to (8.6), the Poisson mean of the smokers, \\(\\mu_{(1)}\\), is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu_{(1)}=e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1}=\\mu_{(2)} \\,e^{\\beta_1} \\quad \\text{or}\\quad \\mu_{(1)}/\\mu_{(2)} =e^{\\beta_1} \\tag{8.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu_{(2)}\\) is the Poisson mean for the non-smokers. This relation between the smokers and non-smokers suggests a useful way to compare the risks embedded in different levels of a given risk factor. That is, the proportional increase in the expected loss frequency of the smokers compared to that of the non-smokers is simply given by a multiplicative factor \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\). Putting another way, if we set the expected loss frequency of the non-smokers as the base value, the expected loss frequency of the smokers is obtained by applying \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) to the base value. Dealing with multi-level case We can readily extend the two-level case to a multi-level one where \\(l\\) different levels are involved for a single rating factor. For this we generally need \\(l-1\\) indicator variables to formulate \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1+\\cdots+\\beta_{l-1} x_{l-1}, \\tag{8.11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(x_k\\) is an indicator variable that takes 1 if the policy belongs to level \\(k\\) and 0 otherwise, for \\(k=1,2, \\ldots, l-1\\). By omitting the indicator variable associated with the last level in (8.11) we effectively chose level \\(l\\) as the base caseThe categorical level chosen as the default with all dummy variable indicators of 0, but this choice is arbitrary and does not matter numerically. The resulting Poisson parameter for policies in level \\(k\\) then becomes, from (8.11), \\[\\begin{equation} \\nonumber \\mu= \\begin{cases} e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_k} &amp; \\text{if the policy belongs to level $k$ (k=1,2, ..., l-1)}, \\\\ e^{\\beta_0} &amp; \\text{if the policy belongs to level $l$}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Thus if we denote the Poisson parameter for policies in level \\(k\\) by \\(\\mu_{(k)}\\), we can relate the Poisson parameter for different levels through \\(\\mu_{(k)}=\\mu_{(l)}\\, e^{\\beta_k}\\), \\(k=1,2, \\ldots, l-1\\). This indicates that, just like the two-level case, the expected loss frequency of the \\(k\\)th level is obtained from the base value multiplied by the relative factor \\(e^{\\beta_k}\\). This relative interpretation becomes more powerful when there are many risk factors with multi-levels, and leads us to a better understanding of the underlying risk and more accurate prediction of future losses. Finally, we note that the varying Poisson mean is completely driven by the coefficient parameters \\(\\beta_k\\)’s, which are to be estimated from the dataset; the procedure of the parameter estimation will be discussed later in this chapter. 8.2.2 Poisson Regression We now describe the Poisson regression in a formal and more general setting. Let us assume that there are \\(n\\) independent policyholders with a set of rating factors characterized by a \\(k\\)-variate vector9. The \\(i\\)th policyholder’s rating factor is thus denoted by vector \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i=(1, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\), and the policyholder has recorded the loss count \\(y_i \\in \\{0,1,2, \\ldots \\}\\) from the last period of loss observation, for \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\). In the regression literature, the values \\(x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\) are generally known as the explanatory variables, as these are measurements providing information about the variable of interest \\(y_i\\). In essence, regression analysis is a method to quantify the relationship between a variable of interest and explanatory variables. We also assume, for now, that all policyholders have the same one unit period for loss observation, or equal exposure of 1, to keep things simple; we will discuss more details on the exposure in the following subsection. As done before, we describe the Poisson regression through its mean function. For this we first denote \\(\\mu_i\\) to be the expected loss count of the \\(i\\)th policyholder under the Poisson specification (8.1): \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu_i=\\mathrm{E~}{(y_i|\\mathbf{ x}_i)}, \\qquad y_i \\sim Pois(\\mu_i), \\, i=1, \\ldots, n. \\tag{8.12} \\end{equation}\\] The condition inside the expectation operation in (8.12) indicates that the loss frequency \\(\\mu_i\\) is the model output responding to the given set of risk factors or explanatory variables. In principle the conditional mean \\(\\mathrm{E~}{(y_i|\\mathbf{ x}_i)}\\) in (8.12) can take different forms depending on how we specify the relationship between \\(\\mathbf{ x}\\) and \\(y\\). The standard choice for the Poisson regression is to adopt the exponential function, as we mentioned previously, so that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu_i=\\mathrm{E~}{(y_i|\\mathbf{ x}_i)}=e^{\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta}, \\qquad y_i \\sim Pois(\\mu_i), \\, i=1, \\ldots, n. \\tag{8.13} \\end{equation}\\] Here \\(\\beta=(\\beta_0, \\ldots, \\beta_k)^{\\prime}\\) is the vector of coefficients so that \\(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1} +\\ldots+\\beta_k x_{ik}\\). The exponential function in (8.13) ensures that \\(\\mu_i &gt;0\\) for any set of rating factors \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i\\). Often (8.13) is rewritten as a log linear form \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu_i=\\log \\mathrm{E~}{(y_i|\\mathbf{ x}_i)}=\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta, \\qquad y_i \\sim Pois(\\mu_i), \\, i=1, \\ldots, n \\tag{8.14} \\end{equation}\\] to reveal the relationship when the right side is set as the linear form, \\(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta\\). Again, we see that the mapping works well as both sides of (8.14), \\(\\log \\mu_i\\) and \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i\\beta\\), can now cover the entire real values. This is the formulation of the Poisson regression, assuming that all policyholders have the same unit period of exposure. When the exposures differ among the policyholders, however, as is the case in most practical cases, we need to revise this formulation by adding exposure component as an additional term in (8.14). 8.2.3 Incorporating Exposure Concept of Exposure In order to determine the size of potential losses in any type of insurance, one must always know the corresponding exposure. The concept of exposure is an extremely important ingredient in insurance pricing, though we usually take it for granted. For example, when we say the expected claim frequency of a health insurance policy is 0.2, it does not mean much without the specification of the exposure such as, in this case, per month or per year. In fact, all premiums and losses need the exposure precisely specified and must be quoted accordingly; otherwise all subsequent statistical analyses and predictions will be distorted. In the previous section we assumed the same unit of exposure across all policyholders, but this is hardly realistic in practice. In health insurance, for example, two different policyholders with different lengths of insurance coverage (e.g., 3 months and 12 months, respectively) could have recorded the same number of claim counts. As the expected number of claim counts would be proportional to the length of coverage, we should not treat these two policyholders’ loss experiences identically in the modeling process. This motivates the need of the concept of exposure in the Poisson regression. The Poisson distribution in (8.1) is parametrized via its mean. To understand the exposure, we alternatively parametrize the Poisson pmf in terms of the rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\), based on the definition of the Poisson process: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr(Y=y)=\\frac{(\\lambda t)^y e^{-\\lambda t}}{y!},\\qquad y=0,1,2, \\ldots \\tag{8.15} \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\mathrm{E~}{(Y)}=\\mathrm{Var~}{(Y)}=\\lambda t\\). Here \\(\\lambda\\) is known as the rate or intensity per unit period of the Poisson process and \\(t\\) represents the length of time or exposure, a known constant value. For given \\(\\lambda\\) the Poisson distribution (8.15) produces a larger expected loss count as the exposure \\(t\\) gets larger. Clearly, (8.15) reduces to (8.1) when \\(t=1\\), which means that the mean and the rate become the same for the unit exposure, the case we considered in the previous subsection. In principle, the exposure does not need to be measured in units of time and may represent different things depending the problem at hand. For example: In health insurance, the rate may be the occurrence of a specific disease per 1,000 people and the exposure is the number of people considered in the unit of 1,000. In auto insurance, the rate may be the number of accidents per year of a driver and the exposure is the length of the observed period for the driver in the unit of year. For workers compensationA no-fault insurance system prescribed by state law where benefits are provided by an employer to an employee due to a job-related injury, including death, resulting from an accident or occupational disease that covers lost wages resulting from an employee’s work-related injury or illness, the rate may be the probability of injury in the course of employment per dollar and the exposure is the payroll amount in dollars. In marketing, the rate may be the number of customers who enter a store per hour and the exposure is the number of hours observed. In civil engineering, the rate may be the number of major cracks on the paved road per 10 kms and the exposure is the length of road considered in the unit of 10 kms. In credit risk modelling, the rate may be the number of default events per 1000 firms and the exposure is the number of firms under consideration in the unit of 1,000. Actuaries may be able to use different exposure basesThe unit of measurement chosen to represent the exposure for a particular risk for a given insurable loss. For example, in auto insurance, both the number of kilometers driven and the number of months covered by insurance can be used as exposure bases. Here the former is more accurate and useful in modelling the losses from car accidents, but more difficult to measure and manage for insurers. Thus, a good exposure base may not be the theoretically best one due to various practical constraints. As a rule, an exposure base must be easy to determine, accurately measurable, legally and socially acceptable, and free from potential manipulation by policyholders. Incorporating exposure in Poisson regression As exposures affect the Poisson mean, constructing Poisson regressions requires us to carefully separate the rate and exposure in the modelling process. Focusing on the insurance context, let us denote the rate of the loss event of the \\(i\\)th policyholder by \\(\\lambda_i\\), the known exposure (the length of coverage) by \\(m_i\\) and the expected loss count under the given exposure by \\(\\mu_i\\). Then the Poisson regression formulation in (8.13) and (8.14) should be revised in light of (8.15) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu_i=\\mathrm{E~}{(y_i|\\mathbf{ x}_i)}=m_i \\,\\lambda_i=m_i \\, e^{\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta}, \\qquad y_i \\sim Pois(\\mu_i), \\, i=1, \\ldots, n, \\tag{8.16} \\end{equation}\\] which gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu_i=\\log m_i+\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta, \\qquad y_i \\sim Pois(\\mu_i), \\, i=1, \\ldots, \\tag{8.17} \\end{equation}\\] Adding \\(\\log m_i\\) in (8.17) does not pose a problem in fitting as we can always specify this as an extra explanatory variable, as it is a known constant, and fix its coefficient to 1. In the literature the log of exposure, \\(\\log m_i\\), is commonly called the offsetNatural log of the exposure amount that is added to a regression model to account for varying exposures.

What potential issue would you have? 8.3 Categorical Variables and Multiplicative Tariff In this section you will learn: The multiplicative tariff model when the rating factors are categorical. How to construct the Poisson regression model based on the multiplicative tariff structure. 8.3.1 Rating Factors and Tariff In practice most rating factors in insurance are categorical variables, meaning that they take one of the pre-determined number of possible values. Examples of categorical variables include sex, type of cars, the driver’s region of residence and occupation. Continuous variables, such as age or auto mileage, can also be grouped by bands and treated as categorical variables. Thus we can imagine that, with a small number of rating factors, there will be many policyholders falling into the same risk class, charged with the same premium. For the remaining of this chapter we assume that all rating factors are categorical variables. To illustrate how categorical variables are used in the pricing process, we consider a hypothetical auto insurance with only two rating factors: Type of vehicle: Type A (personally owned) and B (owned by corporations). We use index \\(j=1\\) and \\(2\\) to respectively represent each level of this rating factor. Age band of the driver: Young (age \\(&lt;\\) 25), middle (25 \\(\\le\\) age \\(&lt;\\) 60) and old age (age \\(\\ge\\) 60). We use index \\(k=1, 2\\) and \\(3\\), respectively, for this rating factor. From this classification rule, we may create an organized table or list, such as the one shown in Table 8.2, collected from all policyholders. Clearly there are \\(2 \\times 3=6\\) different risk classes in total. Each row of the table shows a combination of different risk characteristics of individual policyholders. Our goal is to compute six different premiums for each of these combinations. Once the premium for each row has been determined using the given exposure and claim counts, the insurer can replace the last two columns in Table 8.2 with a single column containing the computed premiums. This new table then can serve as a manual to determine the premium for a new policyholder given the rating factors during the underwriting process. In non-life insurance, a table (or a set of tables) or list that contains each set of rating factors and the associated premium is referred to as a tariffA table or list that contains the rating factors and associated premiums and other risk information. Each unique combination of the rating factors in a tariff is called a tariff cell; thus, in Table 8.2 the number of tariff cells is six, same as the number of risk classes. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ccrrc} \\hline \\text{Rating} &amp;\\text{factors} &amp; \\text{Exposure} &amp; \\text{Claim count} \\\\ \\text{Type }(j) &amp; \\text{Age }(k) &amp; \\text{in year} &amp; \\text{observed}\\\\ \\hline \\hline j=1 &amp; k=1 &amp; 89.1 &amp; 9\\\\ 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 208.5&amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 155.2 &amp; 6 \\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 19.3 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 360.4 &amp; 13 \\\\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 276.7 &amp; 6 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 8.2 : Loss record of the illustrative auto insurer Let us now look at the loss information in Table 8.2 more closely. The exposure in each row represents the sum of the length of insurance coverages, or in-force timesThe timeframe during which a policy is active and the insurer is bound by the contractual obligation, in the unit of year, of all the policyholders in that tariff cell. Similarly the claim counts in each row is the number of claims at each cell. Naturally the exposures and claim counts vary due to the different number of drivers across the cells, as well as different in-force time periods among the drivers within each cell. In light of the Poisson regression framework, we denote the exposure and claim count of cell \\((j,k)\\) as \\(m_{jk}\\) and \\(y_{jk}\\), respectively, and define the claim count per unit exposure as \\[\\begin{equation} \\nonumber z_{jk}= \\frac{y_{jk}}{ m_{jk}}, \\qquad j=1,2;\\, k=1, 2,3. \\end{equation}\\] For example, \\(z_{12}=8/208.5=0.03837\\), meaning that a policyholder in tariff cell (1,2) would have 0.03837 accidents if insured for a full year on average. The set of \\(z_{ij}\\) values then corresponds to the rate parameterParameter in certain distributions, such as the exponential, that indicate how quickly the function decays, and it is the reciprocal of the scale parameter in the Poisson distribution (8.15) as they are the event occurrence rates per unit exposure. That is, we have \\(z_{jk}=\\hat{\\lambda}_{jk}\\) where \\({\\lambda}_{jk}\\) is the Poisson rate parameter. Producing \\(z_{ij}\\) values however does not do much beyond comparing the average loss frequencies across risk classes. To fully exploit the dataset, we will construct a pricing model from Table 8.2 using the Poisson regression, for the remaining part of the chapter. We comment that actual loss records used by insurers typically include much more risk factors, in which case the number of cells grows exponentially. The tariff would then consist of a set of tables, instead of one, separated by some of the basic rating factors, such as sex or territory. 8.3.2 Multiplicative Tariff Model In this subsection, we introduce the multiplicative tariff modelA rating method where each rating factor is the product of parameters associated with that rating factor, a popular pricing structure that can be naturally used within the Poisson regression framework. The developments here are based on Table 8.2. Recall that the loss count of a policyholder is described by the Poisson regression model with rate \\(\\lambda\\) and the exposure \\(m\\), so that the expected loss count becomes \\(m\\lambda\\). As \\(m\\) is a known constant, we are essentially concerned with modelling \\(\\lambda\\), so that it responds to the change in the rating factors. Among other possible functional formsThe algebraic relationship between a dependent variable and explanatory variables, we commonly choose the multiplicative10 relation to model the Poisson rate \\(\\lambda_{jk}\\) for rating factor (\\(j,k\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda_{jk}= f_0 \\times f_{1j} \\times f_{2k}, \\qquad j=1,2;\\, k=1, 2,3. \\tag{8.18} \\end{equation}\\] Here \\(\\{ f_{1j}, j=1,2\\}\\) are the parameters associated with the two levels in the first rating factor, car type, and \\(\\{ f_{2k}, k=1,2,3\\}\\) associated with the three levels in the age band, the second rating factor. For instance, the Poisson rate for a mid-aged policyholder with a Type B vehicle is given by \\(\\lambda_{22}=f_0 \\times f_{12} \\times f_{22}\\). The first term \\(f_0\\) is some base value to be discussed shortly. Thus these six parameters are understood as numerical representations of the levels within each rating factor, and are to be estimated from the dataset. The multiplicative form (8.18) is easy to understand and use, because it clearly shows how the expected loss count (per unit exposure) changes as each rating factor varies. For example, if \\(f_{11}=1\\) and \\(f_{12}=1.2\\), then the expected loss count of a policyholder with a vehicle of type B would be 20\\(\\%\\) larger than type A, when the other factors are the same. In non-life insurance, the parameters \\(f_{1j}\\) and \\(f_{2k}\\) are known as relativitiesA numerical estimate of value in one category relative to the value in a base classification, typically expressed as a factor as they determine how much expected loss should change relative to the base value \\(f_0\\). The idea of relativity is quite convenient in practice, as we can decide the premium for a policyholder by simply multiplying a series of corresponding relativities to the base value. Dropping an existing rating factor or adding a new one is also transparent with this multiplicative structure. In addition, the insurer may easily adjust the overall premium for all policyholders by controlling the base value \\(f_0\\) without changing individual relativities. However, by adopting the multiplicative form, we implicitly assume that there is no serious interaction among the risk factors. When the multiplicative form is used we need to address an identification issue. That is, for any \\(c&gt;0\\), we can write \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda_{jk}= f_0 \\times \\frac{f_{1j}}{c} \\times c\\,f_{2k}. \\end{equation}\\] By comparing with (8.18), we see that the identical rate parameter \\(\\lambda_{jk}\\) can be obtained for very different individual relativities. This over-parametrization, meaning that many different sets of parameters arrive at the identical model, obviously calls for some restriction on \\(f_{1j}\\) and \\(f_{2k}\\). The standard practice is to make one relativity in each rating factor equal to one. This can be made arbitrarily in theory, but the standard practice is to make the relativity of most common class (base class) equals to one. We will assume that type A vehicles and young drivers to be the most common classes, that is, \\(f_{11} = 1\\) and \\(f_{21} = 1\\). This way all other relativities are uniquely determined. The tariff cell \\((j,k)=(1,1)\\) is then called the base tariff cellThe chosen set of rating categories where the rate equals the intercept of the model (the base value), where the rate simply becomes \\(\\lambda_{11}=f_0\\), corresponding to the base value according to (8.18). Thus the base value \\(f_0\\) is generally interpreted as the Poisson rate of the base tariff cell. Again, (8.18) is log-transformed and rewritten as \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\lambda_{jk}= \\log f_0 + \\log f_{1j} + \\log f_{2k}, \\tag{8.19} \\end{equation}\\] as it is easier to work with in estimating process, similar to (8.14). This log linear form makes the log relativities of the base level in each rating factor equal to zero, i.e., \\(\\log f_{11}=\\log f_{21}=0\\), and leads to the following alternative, more explicit expression for (8.19): \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\lambda=\\begin{cases} \\log f_0 + \\quad 0 \\quad \\,\\,+ \\quad 0 \\quad \\,\\,&amp; \\text{for a policy in cell $(1,1)$}, \\\\ \\log f_0+ \\quad 0 \\quad \\,\\,+\\log f_{22}&amp; \\text{for a policy in cell $(1,2)$}, \\\\ \\log f_0+ \\quad 0 \\quad \\,\\,+\\log f_{23}&amp; \\text{for a policy in cell $(1,3)$}, \\\\ \\log f_0+\\log f_{12}+ \\quad 0 \\quad \\,\\,&amp; \\text{for a policy in cell $(2,1)$}, \\\\ \\log f_0+\\log f_{12}+\\log f_{22}&amp; \\text{for a policy in cell $(2,2)$}, \\\\ \\log f_0+\\log f_{12}+\\log f_{23}&amp; \\text{for a policy in cell $(2,3)$}. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\tag{8.20} \\end{equation}\\] This clearly shows that the Poisson rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\) varies across different tariff cells, with the same log linear form used in the Poisson regression framework. In fact the reader may see that (8.20) is an extended version of the early expression (8.6) with multiple risk factors and that the log relativities now play the role of \\(\\beta_i\\) parameters. Therefore all the relativities can be readily estimated via fitting a Poisson regression with a suitably chosen set of indicator variables. 8.3.3 Poisson Regression for Multiplicative Tariff Indicator Variables for Tariff Cells We now explain how the relativities can be incorporated in the Poisson regression. As seen early in this chapter we use indicator variables to deal with categorical variables. For our illustrative auto insurer, therefore, we define an indicator variable for the first rating factor as \\[\\begin{equation} x_1= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{ for vehicle type B}, \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{ otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] For the second rating factor, we employ two indicator variables for the age band, that is, \\[\\begin{equation} x_2= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{for age band 2}, \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} x_3= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{for age band 3}, \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] The triple \\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\\) then can effectively and uniquely determine each risk class. By observing that the indicator variables associated with Type A and Age band 1 are omitted, we see that tariff cell \\((j,k)=(1,1)\\) plays the role of the base cell. We emphasize that our choice of the three indicator variables above has been carefully made so that it is consistent with the choice of the base levels in the multiplicative tariff model in the previous subsection (i.e., \\(f_{11}=1\\) and \\(f_{21}=1\\)). With the proposed indicator variables we can rewrite the log rate (8.19) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\lambda_{}= \\log f_0+ \\log f_{12} \\times x_1 + \\log f_{22} \\times x_2 +\\log f_{23} \\times x_3, \\tag{8.21} \\end{equation}\\] which is identical to (8.20) when each triple value is actually applied. For example, we can verify that the base tariff cell \\((j,k)=(1,1)\\) corresponds to \\((x_1, x_2,x_3)=(0, 0, 0)\\), and in turn produces \\(\\log \\lambda=\\log f_0\\) or \\(\\lambda= f_0\\) in (8.21) as required. Poisson regression for the tariff model Under this specification, let us consider \\(n\\) policyholders in the portfolio with the \\(i\\)th policyholder’s risk characteristic given by a vector of explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i=(x_{i1}, x_{i2},x_{i3})^{\\prime}\\), for \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\). We then recognize (8.21) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\lambda_{i}= \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 \\, x_{i1} + \\beta_{2} \\, x_{i2} +\\beta_3 \\, x_{i3}=\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta, \\qquad i=1, \\ldots, n, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_0, \\ldots, \\beta_3\\) can be mapped to the corresponding log relativities in (8.21). This is exactly the same setup as in (8.17) except for the exposure component. Therefore, by incorporating the exposure in each risk class, the Poisson regression model for this multiplicative tariff model finally becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\mu_i=\\log \\lambda_{i}+\\log m_i= \\log m_i+ \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 \\, x_{i1} + \\beta_{2} \\, x_{i2} +\\beta_3 \\, x_{i3}=\\log m_i+\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta, \\end{equation}\\] for \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\). As a result, the relativities are given by \\[\\begin{equation} {f}_0=e^{\\beta_0}, \\quad {f}_{12}=e^{\\beta_1}, \\quad {f}_{22}=e^{\\beta_2} \\quad \\text{and}\\quad {f}_{23}=e^{\\beta_3}, \\tag{8.22} \\end{equation}\\] with \\(f_{11}=1\\) and \\(f_{21}=1\\) from the original construction. For the actual dataset, \\(\\beta_i\\), \\(i=0,1, 2, 3\\), is replaced with the mle \\(b_i\\) using the method in the technical supplement at the end of this chapter (Section 8.A). 8.3.4 Numerical Examples We present two numerical examples of the Poisson regression. In the first example we construct a Poisson regression model from Table 8.2, which is a dataset of a hypothetical auto insurer. The second example uses an actual industry dataset with more risk factors. As our purpose is to show how the Poisson regression model can be used under a given classification rule, we are not concerned with the quality of the Poisson model fit in this chapter. Example 8.1: Poisson regression for the illustrative auto insurer In the last few subsections we considered a dataset of a hypothetical auto insurer with two risk factors, as given in Table 8.2. We now apply the Poisson regression model to this dataset. As done before, we have set \\((j,k)=(1,1)\\) as the base tariff cell, so that \\(f_{11}=f_{21}=1\\). The result of the regression gives the coefficient estimates \\((b_0, b_1,b_2,b_3)=(-2.3359, -0.3004, -0.7837, -1.0655 )\\), which in turn produces the corresponding relativities \\[\\begin{equation} \\nonumber {f}_0=0.0967, \\quad {f}_{12}= 0.7405, \\quad {f}_{22}=0.4567 \\quad \\text{and}\\quad {f}_{23}=0.3445. \\end{equation}\\] from the relation given in (8.22). The R script and the output are as follows.

Poisson regression for Singapore insurance claims data This actual dataset is a subset of the data used by (Frees and Valdez 2008). The data are from the General Insurance Association of Singapore, an organisation consisting of non-life insurers in Singapore. The data contains the number of car accidents for \\(n=7,483\\) auto insurance policies with several categorical explanatory variables and the exposure for each policy. The explanatory variables include four risk factors: the type of the vehicle insured (either automobile (A) or other (O), denoted by \\(\\tt{Vtype}\\)), the age of the vehicle in years (\\(\\tt{Vage}\\)), gender of the policyholder (\\(\\tt{Sex}\\)) and the age of the policyholder (in years, grouped into seven categories, denoted \\(\\tt{Age}\\)). Based on the data description, there are several things to remember before constructing a model. First, there are 3,842 policies with vehicle type A (automobile) and 3,641 policies with other vehicle types. However, age and sex information is available for the policies of vehicle type A only; the drivers of all other types of vehicles are recorded to be aged 21 or less with sex unspecified, except for one policy, indicating that no driver information has been collected for non-automobile vehiclesMotorized vehicles which are not autos, such as atvs, off-road vehicles, go-carts, etc.. Second, type A vehicles are all classified as private vehicles and all the other types are not. When we include these risk factors, we assume all unspecified sex to be male. As the age information is only applicable to type A vehicles, we set the model accordingly. That is, we apply the age variable only to vehicles of type A. Also we used five vehicle age bands, simplifying the original seven bands, by combining vehicle ages 0,1 and 2; the combined band is marked as level 211 in the data file. Thus our Poisson model has the following explicit form: \\[\\begin{align*} \\log \\mu_i= \\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta+&amp;\\log m_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 I(Sex_i=M)+ \\sum_{t=2}^6 \\beta_t\\, I(Vage_i=t) \\\\ &amp;+ \\sum_{t=7}^{13} \\beta_t \\,I(Vtype_i=A)\\times I(Age_i=t-7)+\\log m_i. \\end{align*}\\] The fitting result is given in Table 8.3, for which we have several comments. The claim frequency is higher for male by 17.3%, when other rating factors are held fixed. However, this may have been affected by the fact that all unspecified sex has been assigned to male. Regarding the vehicle age, the claim frequency gradually decreases as the vehicle gets old, when other rating factors are held fixed. The level starts from 2 for this variable but, again, the numbering is nominal and does not affect the numerical result. The policyholder age variable only applies to type A (automobile) vehicle, and there is no policy in the first age band. We may speculate that younger drivers less than age 21 drive their parents’ cars rather than having their own because of high insurance premiums or related regulations. The missing relativity may be estimated by some interpolation or the professional judgement of the actuary. The claim frequency is the lowest for age band 3 and 4, but gets substantially higher for older age bands, a reasonable pattern seen in many auto insurance loss datasets. We also note that there is no base level in the policyholder age variable, in the sense that no relativity is equal to 1. This is because the variable is only applicable to vehicle type A. This does not cause a problem numerically, but one may set the base relativity as follows if necessary for other purposes. Since there is no policy in age band 0, we consider band 1 as the base case. Specifically, we treat its relativity as a product of 0.918 and 1, where the former is the common relativity (that is, the common premium reduction) applied to all policies with vehicle type A and the latter is the base value for age band 1. Then the relativity of age band 2 can be seen as \\(0.917=0.918 \\times 0.999\\), where 0.999 is understood as the relativity for age band 2. The remaining age bands can be treated similarly. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{clcc} \\hline \\text{Rating factor} &amp; \\text{Level} &amp; \\text{Relativity in the tariff} &amp; \\text{Note}\\\\ \\hline\\hline \\text{Base value} &amp; &amp; 0.167 &amp; f_0\\\\ \\hline \\text{Sex} &amp; 1 (F) &amp; 1.000 &amp; \\text{Base level}\\\\ &amp; 2 (M) &amp; 1.173 &amp;\\\\\\hline \\text{Vehicle age} &amp; 2 (0-2\\text{ yrs}) &amp; 1.000 &amp; \\text{Base level}\\\\ &amp; 3 (3-5\\text{ yrs}) &amp; 0.843 \\\\ &amp; 4 (6-10\\text{ yrs}) &amp; 0.553 \\\\ &amp; 5 (11-15\\text{ yrs}) &amp; 0.269 \\\\ &amp; 6 (16+\\text{ yrs}) &amp; 0.189 &amp;\\\\\\hline \\text{Policyholder age} &amp; 0 (0-21) &amp; \\text{N/A} &amp; \\text{No policy} \\\\ \\text{(Only applicable to} &amp; 1 (22-25) &amp; 0.918 \\\\ \\text{vehicle type A)} &amp; 2 (26-35) &amp; 0.917 \\\\ &amp; 3 (36-45) &amp; 0.758 \\\\ &amp; 4 (46-55) &amp; 0.632 \\\\ &amp; 5 (56-65) &amp; 1.102\\\\ &amp; 6 (65+) &amp; 1.179\\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} } \\] Table 8.3 : Singapore insurance claims data Let us try several examples based on Table 8.3.

Actually, the Poisson distribution can be restrictive in the sense that it has a single parameter and its mean and the variance are always equal. There are other count regression models that allow more flexible distributional structureThe manner in which a statistical distribution is parameterized, such as negative binomial regressions and zero-inflated (ZI) regressions; details of these alternative regressions can be found in other texts listed in the next section. Show Quiz Solution 8.4 Further Resources and Contributors Further Reading and References The Poisson regression is a special member of a more general regression model class known as the generalized linear model (glm). The glm develops a unified regression framework for datasets when the response variables are continuous, binary or discrete. The classical linear regression model with normal error is also a member of the glm. There are many standard statistical texts dealing with the glm, including (Peter McCullagh and Nelder 1989). More accessible texts are (Dobson and Barnett 2008), (Agresti 1996) and (Faraway 2016). For actuarial and insurance applications of the glm see (Edward W. Frees 2009a), (De Jong and Heller 2008). Also, (Ohlsson and Johansson 2010) discusses the glm in non-life insurance pricing context with tariff analyses. Contributor Joseph H. T.

Estimating Poisson Regression Models The principles of maximum likelihood estimation (mle) are introduced in Sections 2.4.1 and 3.5, defined in Section 15.2.2, and theoretically developed in Chapter 17. Here we present the mle procedure of the Poisson regression so that the reader can see how the explanatory variables are treated in maximizing the likelihood function in the regression setting. Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Individual Data In the Poisson regression the varying Poisson mean is determined by parameters \\(\\beta_i\\)’s, as shown in (8.17). In this subsection we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate these parameters. Again, we assume that there are \\(n\\) policyholders and the \\(i\\)th policyholder is characterized by \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i=(1, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\) with the observed loss count \\(y_i\\). Then, from (8.16) and (8.17), the log-likelihood function of vector \\(\\beta=(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_k)\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align} \\nonumber \\log L(\\beta) &amp;= l(\\beta)=\\sum^n_{i=1} \\left( -\\mu_i +y_i \\, \\log \\mu_i -\\log y_i! \\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum^n_{i=1} \\left( -m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta) +y_i \\,(\\log m_i+\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i\\beta) -\\log y_i! \\right) \\tag{8.23} \\end{align}\\] To obtain the mle of \\(\\beta=(\\beta_0, \\ldots, \\beta_k)^{\\prime}\\), we differentiate12 \\(l(\\beta)\\) with respect to vector \\(\\beta\\) and set it to zero: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}l(\\beta)\\Bigg{|}_{\\beta=\\mathbf{b}}=\\sum^n_{i=1} \\left(y_i -m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i \\mathbf{ b}) \\right)\\mathbf{ x}_i=\\mathbf{ 0}. \\tag{8.24} \\end{equation}\\] Numerically solving this equation system gives the mle of \\(\\beta\\), denoted by \\(\\mathbf{ b}=(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_k)^{\\prime}\\). Note that, as \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i=(1, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\) is a column vector, equation (8.24) is a system of \\(k+1\\) equations with both sides written as column vectors of size \\(k+1\\). If we denote \\(\\hat{\\mu}_i=m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i \\mathbf{ b})\\), we can rewrite (8.24) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum^n_{i=1} \\left(y_i -\\hat{\\mu}_i \\right)\\mathbf{ x}_i=\\mathbf{ 0}. \\end{equation}\\] Since the solution \\(\\mathbf{ b}\\) satisfies this equation, it follows that the first among the array of \\(k+1\\) equations, corresponding to the first constant element of \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i\\), yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum^n_{i=1}\\left( y_i -\\hat{\\mu}_i \\right)\\times 1={ 0}, \\end{equation}\\] which implies that we must have \\[\\begin{equation} n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i =\\bar{y}=n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{\\mu}_i. \\end{equation}\\] This is an interesting property saying that the average of the individual losses, \\(\\bar{y}\\), is same as the average of the estimated values. That is, the sample mean is preserved under the fitted Poisson regression model. Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Grouped Data Sometimes the data are not available at the individual policy level. For example, Table 8.2 provides collective loss information for each risk class after grouping individual policies. When this is the case, \\(y_i\\) and \\(m_i\\), the quantities needed for the mle calculation in (8.24), are unavailable for each \\(i\\). However this does not pose a problem as long as we have the total loss counts and total exposure for each risk class. To elaborate, let us assume that there are \\(K\\) different risk classes, and further that, in the \\(k\\)th risk class, we have \\(n_k\\) policies with the total exposure \\(m_{(k)}\\) and the average loss count \\(\\bar{y}_{(k)}\\), for \\(k=1, \\ldots, K\\); the total loss count for the \\(k\\)th risk class is then \\(n_k\\, \\bar{y}_{(k)}\\). We denote the set of indices of the policies belonging to the \\(k\\)th class by \\(C_k\\). As all policies in a given risk class share the same risk characteristics, we may denote \\(\\mathbf{ x}_i=\\mathbf{ x}_{(k)}\\) for all \\(i \\in C_k\\). With this notation, we can rewrite (8.24) as \\[\\begin{align} \\nonumber \\sum^n_{i=1} \\left(y_i -m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i \\mathbf{ b}) \\right)\\mathbf{ x}_i &amp;= \\sum^K_{k=1}\\Big{\\{}\\sum_{i \\in C_k} \\left(y_i -m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i \\mathbf{ b}) \\right)\\mathbf{ x}_i \\Big{\\}} \\\\ \\nonumber &amp; =\\sum^K_{k=1}\\Big{\\{} \\sum_{i \\in C_k} \\left(y_i -m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_{(k)} \\mathbf{ b}) \\right)\\mathbf{ x}_{(k)} \\Big{\\}} \\\\ \\nonumber &amp; =\\sum^K_{k=1}\\Big{\\{} \\Big(\\sum_{i \\in C_k}y_i -\\sum_{i \\in C_k}m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_{(k)} \\mathbf{ b}) \\Big)\\mathbf{ x}_{(k)} \\Big{\\}} \\\\ &amp; =\\sum^K_{k=1} \\Big(n_k\\, \\bar{y}_{(k)}-m_{(k)} \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_{(k)} \\mathbf{ b}) \\Big)\\mathbf{ x}_{(k)} =0. \\tag{8.25} \\end{align}\\] Since \\(n_k\\, \\bar{y}_{(k)}\\) in (8.25) represents the total loss count for the \\(k\\)th risk class and \\(m_{(k)}\\) is its total exposure, we see that for the Poisson regression the mle \\(\\mathbf{ b}\\) is the same whether if we use the individual data or the grouped data. Information matrix Section 17.1 defines information matrices. Taking second derivatives to (8.23) gives the information matrixMatrix that measures the amount of information that an observable random variable x carries about an unknown parameter of a distribution, and is used to calculate covariance matrices of maximum likelihood estimators of the mle estimators, \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{ I}(\\beta)=-\\mathrm{E~}{\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\beta\\partial \\beta^{\\prime}}l(\\beta) \\right)}=\\sum^n_{i=1}m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i \\mathbf{ \\beta})\\mathbf{ x}_i \\mathbf{ x}_i^{\\prime}=\\sum^n_{i=1} {\\mu}_i \\mathbf{ x}_i \\mathbf{ x}_i^{\\prime}. \\tag{8.26} \\end{equation}\\] For actual datasets, \\({\\mu}_i\\) in (8.26) is replaced with \\(\\hat{\\mu}_i=m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i \\mathbf{ b})\\) to estimate the relevant variances and covariances of the mle \\(\\mathbf{ b}\\) or its functions. For grouped datasets, we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{ I}(\\beta)=\\sum^K_{k=1} \\Big{\\{}\\sum_{i \\in C_k}m_i \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_i \\mathbf{ \\beta})\\mathbf{ x}_i \\mathbf{ x}_i^{\\prime} \\Big{\\}}=\\sum^K_{k=1} m_{(k)} \\exp(\\mathbf{ x}^{\\prime}_{(k)} \\mathbf{ \\beta})\\mathbf{ x}_{(k)} \\mathbf{ x}_{(k)}^{\\prime}. \\end{equation}\\] TS 8.B. Selecting Rating Factors A complete discussion of rating factor selection is beyond the scope of this book. In addition to technical analyses, you have to think carefully about the type of business (personal, commercial) as well as the regulatory landscape. Nonetheless, a broad overview of some key concerns may serve to ground the reader as one thinks about the pricing of insurance contracts. Statistical Criteria From an analyst’s perspective, the discussion starts with the statistical significance of a rating factor. If the factor is not statistically significant, then the variable is not even worthy of consideration for inclusion in a rating plan. The statistical significance is judged not only on an in-sample basis but also on how well it fares on an out-of-sample basis, as per our discussion in Section 4.2. It is common in insurance applications to have many rating factors. Handling multivariate aspects can be difficult with traditional univariate methods. Analysts employ techniques such as generalized linear models as described in Section 8.3. Rating factors are introduced are use to create cells that contain similar risks. A rating group should be large enough to measure costs with sufficient accuracy. There is an inherent trade-off between theoretical accuracy and homogeneity As an example, most insurers charge the same automobile insurance premiums for drivers between the ages of 30 and 50, not varying the premium by age. Presumably costs do not vary much by age, or cost variances are due to other identifiable factors. Operational Criteria From a business perspective, statistical criteria only provide a starting point for discussions of potential inclusion of rating factors. Inclusion of a rating factor must also induce economically meaningful results. From an insured’s perspective, if differentiation by a factor produces little change in a rate then it is not worth including. From an insurer’s perspective, the inclusion of a factor should help segment the marketplace in a way that helps attract the business that they seek. For example, we introduce the Gini indexA measure for assessing income inequality. it measures the discrepancy between the income and population distributions and is calculated from the lorenz curve. in Section 7.6 as one metric that insurers use to describe the financial impact of a rating variable. Rating factors should also be objective, inexpensive to administer, and verifiable. For example, automobile insurance underwriters often talk of “maturity” and “responsibility” as important criteria for youthful drivers. Yet, these are difficult to define objectively and to apply consistently. As another example, in automobile it has long been known that amount of miles (or kilometers) driven is an excellent rating factor. However, insurers have been reluctant to adopt this factor because it is subject to abuse. Historically, driving mileage has not been used because of the difficulty in verifying this variable (it is far too easy to alter the car’s odometer to change reported mileage). Going forward, modern day drivers and cars are equipped with global positioning devices and other equipment that allow insurers to use distance driven as a rating factor because it can be verified. Rating Factors from the Perspective of a Consumer Insurance companies sell insurance products to a variety of consumers; consequently, companies are affected by public perception. On the one hand, free market competition dictates rating factors that insurers use, as is common in commercial insurance. On the other hand, insurance may be required by law. This is common in personal insurance such as third party automobile liability and homeowners. In these instances, the mandatory and de facto mandatory purchase of insurance may mean that free market competition is insufficient to protect policyholders. Here, the following items affect the social acceptability of using a particular risk characteristic as a rating variable: Affordability - introduction of some variables may be mitigated by resulting high costs of insurance. Causality - other things being equal, a rating variable is easier to justify if there is a “causal” relationship with losses. A good example is the effects of smoking in life insurance. For many years, this factor was viewed with suspicion by the industry. However, over time, scientific evidence provided overwhelming evidence as this an important predictor of mortality. Controllability - A controllable variable is one that is under the control of the insured, e.g., installing burglar alarms. The use of controllable rating variables encourages accident prevention. Privacy concerns - people are reluctant to disclose personal information. In today’s world with increasing emphasis on social media and the availability of personal information, consumer advocates are concerned that the benefits of big data skew heavily in insurers’ favor. They reason that insureds do not have equivalent new tools to compare quality of coverage/policies and performance of insurance companies. Example: Youthful Drivers. In some cases, a particular risk characteristic may identify a small group of insureds whose risk level is extremely high, and if used as a rating variable, the resulting premium may be unaffordable for that high-risk class. To the extent that this occurs, companies may wish to or be required by regulators to combine classes and introduce subsidies. For example, 16-year-old drivers are generally higher risk than 17-year-old drivers. Some companies have chosen to use the same rates for 16- and 17-year-old drivers to minimize the affordability issues that arise when a family adds a 16-year-old to the auto policy. Societal Effects of Rating Factors With public discussions of rating factors, it is also important to think about the societal effects of classification. For example, does a rating variable encourage “good” behavior? As an example, we return to the use of distance driven as a rating factor. Many people advocate for including this variable as a factor. The motivation is that if insurance, like fuel, is priced based on distance driven, this will induce consumers to reduce the amount driven, thereby benefitting society. One can consider other aspects of societal effects of classification, see, for example, Niehaus and Harrington (2003): Re-distributive Effects - provide a cross-subsidy from e.g., high risks to low risks Classification Costs - Money spent by society, insurers, to classify people appropriately. Legal Criteria For example, some states have statutes prohibiting the use of gender in rating insurance while others permit it as a rating variable. As a result, an insurer writing in multiple states may include gender as a rating variable in those states where it is permitted, but not include it in a state that prohibits its use for rating. If allowed by law, the company may continue to charge the average rate but utilize the characteristic to identify, attract, and select the lower-risk insureds that exist in the insured population; this is called skimming the cream.

This chapter introduces credibility theory which is an important actuarial tool for estimating pure premiums, frequencies, and severities for individual risks or classes of risks. Credibility theory provides a convenient framework for combining the experience for an individual risk or class with other data to produce more stable and accurate estimates. Several models for calculating credibility estimates will be discussed including limited fluctuation, Bühlmann, Bühlmann-Straub, and nonparametric and semiparametric credibility methods. The chapter will also show a connection between credibility theory and Bayesian estimation which was introduced in Chapter 4. 9.1 Introduction to Applications of Credibility Theory What premium should be charged to provide insurance? The answer depends upon the exposure to the risk of loss. A common method to compute an insurance premium is to rate an insured using a classification rating planA rating plan that uses an insured’s risk characteristics to determine premium. A classification plan is used to select an insurance rate based on an insured’s rating characteristics such as geographic territory, age, etc. All classification rating plans use a limited set of criteria to group insureds into a “class” and there will be variation in the risk of loss among insureds within the class. An experience rating plan attempts to capture some of the variation in the risk of loss among insureds within a rating class by using the insured’s own loss experience to complement the rate from the classification rating plan. One way to do this is to use a credibility weightThe weight assigned to an insured’s historical loss experience for the purposes of determining their premium in an experience rating plan \\(Z\\) with \\(0\\leq Z \\leq 1\\) to compute \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{R}=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)M, \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{R}&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{credibility weighted rate for risk,}\\\\ \\bar{X}&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{average loss for the risk over a specified time period,}\\\\ M&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{the rate for the classification group, often called the manual rate.}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] For a risk whose loss experience is stable from year to year, \\(Z\\) might be close to 1. For a risk whose losses vary widely from year to year, \\(Z\\) may be close to 0. Credibility theory is also used for computing rates for individual classes within a classification rating plan. When classification plan rates are being determined, some or many of the groups may not have sufficient data to produce stable and reliable rates. The actual loss experience for a group will be assigned a credibility weight \\(Z\\) and the complement of credibilityThe remainder of the weight not assigned to an insured’s historical loss experience in the experience rating plan \\(1-Z\\) may be given to the average experience for risks across all classes. Or, if a class rating plan is being updated, the complement of credibility may be assigned to the current class rateAverage rate per exposure for an insured in a particular classification group. Credibility theory can also be applied to the calculation of expected frequencies and severities. Computing numeric values for \\(Z\\) requires analysis and understanding of the data. What are the variances in the number of losses and sizes of losses for risks? What is the variance between expected values across risks? Show Quiz Solution 9.2 Limited Fluctuation Credibility In this section, you learn how to: Calculate full credibility standards for number of claims, average size of claims, and aggregate losses. Learn how the relationship between means and variances of underlying distributions affects full credibility standards. Determine credibility-weight \\(Z\\) using the square-root partial credibility formula. Limited fluctuation credibilityA credibility method that attempts to limit fluctuations in its estimates, also called “classical credibility”, was given this name because the method explicitly attempts to limit fluctuations in estimates for claim frequencies, severities, or losses. For example, suppose that you want to estimate the expected number of claims \\(N\\) for a group of risks in an insurance rating class. How many risks are needed in the class to ensure that a specified level of accuracy is attained in the estimate? First the question will be considered from the perspective of how many claims are needed. 9.2.1 Full Credibility for Claim Frequency Let \\(N\\) be a random variable representing the number of claims for a group of risks, for example, risks within a particular rating classification. The observed number of claims will be used to estimate \\(\\mu_N=\\mathrm{E}[N]\\), the expected number of claims. How big does \\(\\mu_N\\) need to be to get a good estimate? One way to quantify the accuracy of the estimate would be a statement like: ``The observed value of \\(N\\) should be within 5\\(\\%\\) of \\(\\mu_N\\) at least 90\\(\\%\\) of the time.&quot; Writing this as a mathematical expression would give \\(\\Pr[0.95\\mu_N\\leq N \\leq1.05\\mu_N] \\geq 0.90\\). Generalizing this statement by letting \\(k\\) replace 5\\(\\%\\) and probability \\(p\\) replace 0.90 gives the equation \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr[(1-k)\\mu_N\\leq N \\leq(1+k)\\mu_N] \\geq p. \\tag{9.1} \\end{equation}\\] The expected number of claims required for the probability on the left-hand side of (9.1) to equal \\(p\\) is called the full credibility standardThe threshold of experience necessary to assign 100% credibility to the insured’s own experience. If the expected number of claims is greater than or equal to the full credibility standard then full credibility can be assigned to the data so \\(Z=1\\). Usually the expected value \\(\\mu_N\\) is not known so full credibility will be assigned to the data if the actual observed number of claims \\(n\\) is greater than or equal to the full credibility standard. The \\(k\\) and \\(p\\) values must be selected and the actuary may rely on experience, judgment, and other factors in making the choices. Subtracting \\(\\mu_N\\) from each term in (9.1) and dividing by the standard deviation \\(\\sigma_N\\) of \\(N\\) gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr\\left[\\frac{-k\\mu_N}{\\sigma_N}\\leq \\frac{N-\\mu_N}{\\sigma_N} \\leq \\frac{k\\mu_N}{\\sigma_N}\\right] \\geq p. \\tag{9.2} \\end{equation}\\] In limited fluctuation credibility the standard normal distribution is used to approximate the distribution for \\((N-\\mu_N)/\\sigma_N\\). If \\(N\\) is the sum of many claims from a large group of similar risks and the claims are independent, then the approximation may be reasonable. Let \\(y_p\\) be the value such that \\(\\Pr[-y_p\\leq (N-\\mu_N)/\\sigma_N \\leq y_p]=\\Phi(y_p)-\\Phi(-y_p)=p\\) where \\(\\Phi( )\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normalCumulative density function for the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Because \\(\\Phi(-y_p)=1-\\Phi(y_p)\\), the equality can be rewritten as \\(2\\Phi(y_p)-1=p\\). Solving for \\(y_p\\) gives \\(y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((p+1)/2)\\) where \\(\\Phi^{-1}( )\\) is the inverse of \\(\\Phi( )\\). Equation (9.2) will be satisfied if \\(k\\mu_N/\\sigma_N \\geq y_p\\) assuming the normal approximation. First we will consider this inequality for the case when \\(N\\) has a Poisson distribution: \\(\\Pr[N=n] = \\lambda^n\\textrm{e}^{-\\lambda}/n!\\). Because \\(\\lambda=\\mu_N=\\sigma_N^2\\) for the Poisson, taking square roots yields \\(\\mu_N^{1/2}=\\sigma_N\\). So, \\(k\\mu_N/\\mu_N^{1/2} \\geq y_p\\) which is equivalent to \\(\\mu_N \\geq (y_p/k)^2\\). Let’s define \\(\\lambda_{kp}\\) to be the value of \\(\\mu_N\\) for which equality holds. Then the full credibility standard for the Poisson distribution is \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda_{kp} = \\left(\\frac{y_p}{k}\\right)^2 \\textrm{with } y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((p+1)/2). \\tag{9.3} \\end{equation}\\] If the expected number of claims \\(\\mu_N\\) is greater than or equal to \\(\\lambda_{kp}\\) then equation (9.1) is assumed to hold and full credibility can be assigned to the data. As noted previously, because \\(\\mu_N\\) is usually unknown, full credibility is given if the observed number of claims \\(n\\) satisfies \\(n \\geq \\lambda_{kp}.\\) Example 9.2.1. The full credibility standard is set so that the observed number of claims is to be within 5% of the expected value with probability \\(p=0.95\\). If the number of claims has a Poisson distribution find the number of claims needed for full credibility. Show Example Solution Solution Referring to a normal table, \\(y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((p+1)/2)=\\Phi^{-1}((0.95+1)/2)\\)=\\(\\Phi^{-1}(0.975)=1.960\\). Using this value and \\(k=.05\\) then \\(\\lambda_{kp} = (y_p/k)^{2}=(1.960/0.05)^{2}=1,536.64\\). After rounding up the full credibility standard is 1,537. If claims are not Poisson distributed then equation (9.2) does not imply (9.3). Setting the upper bound of \\((N-\\mu_N)/\\sigma_N\\) in (9.2) equal to \\(y_p\\) gives \\(k\\mu_N/\\sigma_N=y_p\\). Squaring both sides and moving everything to the right side except for one of the \\(\\mu_N\\)’s gives \\(\\mu_N=(y_p/k)^2(\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)\\). This is the full credibility standard for frequency and will be denoted by \\(n_f\\), \\[\\begin{equation} n_f=\\left(\\frac{y_p}{k}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_N^2}{\\mu_N}\\right)=\\lambda_{kp}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_N^2}{\\mu_N}\\right). \\tag{9.4} \\end{equation}\\] This is the same equation as the Poisson full credibility standard except for the \\((\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)\\) multiplier. When the claims distribution is Poisson this extra term is one because the variance equals the mean. Example 9.2.2. The full credibility standard is set so that the total number of claims is to be within 5\\(\\%\\) of the observed value with probability \\(p=0.95\\). The number of claims has a negative binomial distribution \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr(N=x)={x+r-1\\choose x} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}\\right)^r \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}\\right)^x \\end{equation*}\\] with \\(\\beta=1\\). Calculate the full credibility standard. Show Example Solution Solution From the prior example, \\(\\lambda_{kp} =1,536.64\\). The mean and variance for the negative binomial are \\(\\mathrm{E}(N)=r\\beta\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(N)=r\\beta(1+\\beta)\\) so \\((\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)=(r\\beta(1+\\beta)/(r\\beta))=1+\\beta\\) which equals 2 when \\(\\beta=1\\). So, \\(n_f=\\lambda_{kp}(\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)=1,536.64(2)=3,073.28\\) and rounding up gives a full credibility standard of 3,074. We see that the negative binomial distribution with \\((\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)&gt;1\\) requires more claims for full credibility than a Poisson distribution for the same \\(k\\) and \\(p\\) values. The next example shows that a binomial distribution which has \\((\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)&lt;1\\) will need fewer claims for full credibility. Example 9.2.3. The full credibility standard is set so that the total number of claims is to be within 5\\(\\%\\) of the observed value with probability \\(p=0.95\\). The number of claims has a binomial distribution \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr(N=x)={m\\choose x}q^x(1-q)^{m-x}. \\end{equation*}\\] Calculate the full credibility standard for \\(q=1/4\\). Show Example Solution Solution From the first example in this section \\(\\lambda_{kp} =1,536.64\\). The mean and variance for a binomial are \\(\\mathrm{E}(N)=mq\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(N)=mq(1-q)\\) so \\((\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)=(mq(1-q)/(mq))=1-q\\) which equals 3/4 when \\(q=1/4\\). So, \\(n_f=\\lambda_{kp}(\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)=1,536.64(3/4)=1,152.48\\) and rounding up gives a full credibility standard of 1,153. Rather than using expected number of claims to define the full credibility standard, the number of exposures can be used for the full credibility standard. An exposure is a measure of risk. For example, one car insured for a full year would be one car-year. Two cars each insured for exactly one-half year would also result in one car-year. Car-years attempt to quantify exposure to loss. Two car-years would be expected to generate twice as many claims as one car-year if the vehicles have the same risk of loss. To translate a full credibility standard denominated in terms of number of claims to a full credibility standard denominated in exposures one needs a reasonable estimate of the expected number of claims per exposure. Example 9.2.4. The full credibility standard should be selected so that the observed number of claims will be within 5\\(\\%\\) of the expected value with probability \\(p=0.95\\). The number of claims has a Poisson distribution. If one exposure is expected to have about 0.20 claims per year, find the number of exposures needed for full credibility. Show Example Solution Solution With \\(p=0.95\\) and \\(k=.05\\), \\(\\lambda_{kp} = (y_p/k)^{2}=(1.960/0.05)^{2}=1,536.64\\) claims are required for full credibility. The claims frequency rate is 0.20 claims/exposures. To convert the full credibility standard to a standard denominated in exposures the calculation is: (1,536.64 claims)/(0.20 claims/exposures) = 7,683.20 exposures. This can be rounded up to 7,684. Frequency can be defined as the number of claims per exposure. Letting \\(m\\) represent number of exposures then the observed claim frequency is \\(N/m\\) which is used to estimate \\(\\mathrm{E}(N/m)\\): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr[(1-k)\\mathrm{E}(N/m)\\leq N/m \\leq(1+k)\\mathrm{E}(N/m)] \\geq p. \\end{equation*}\\] Because the number of exposures is not a random variable, \\(\\mathrm{E}(N/m)=\\mathrm{E}(N)/m=\\mu_N/m\\) and the prior equation becomes \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr\\left[(1-k)\\frac{\\mu_N}{m}\\leq \\frac{N}{m} \\leq(1+k)\\frac{\\mu_N}{m}\\right] \\geq p. \\end{equation*}\\] Multiplying through by \\(m\\) results in equation (9.1) at the beginning of the section. The full credibility standards that were developed for estimating expected number of claims also apply to frequency. 9.2.2 Full Credibility for Aggregate Losses and Pure Premium Aggregate losses are the total of all loss amounts for a risk or group of risks. Letting \\(S\\) represent aggregate losses then \\[\\begin{equation*} S=X_1+X_2+\\cdots+X_N. \\end{equation*}\\] The random variable \\(N\\) represents the number of losses and random variables \\(X_1, X_2,\\ldots,X_N\\) are the individual loss amounts. In this section it is assumed that \\(N\\) is independent of the loss amounts and that \\(X_1, X_2,\\ldots,X_N\\) are iidIndependent and identically distributed. The mean and variance of \\(S\\) are \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mu_S=\\mathrm{E}(S)=\\mathrm{E}(N)\\mathrm{E}(X)=\\mu_N\\mu_X\\textrm{ and} \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sigma^{2}_S=\\mathrm{Var}(S)=\\mathrm{E}(N)\\mathrm{Var}(X)+[\\mathrm{E}(X)]^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(N)=\\mu_N\\sigma^{2}_X+\\mu^{2}_X\\sigma^{2}_N. \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(X\\) is the amount of a single loss. Observed losses \\(S\\) will be used to estimate expected losses \\(\\mu_S=\\mathrm{E}(S)\\). As with the frequency model in the previous section, the observed losses must be close to the expected losses as quantified in the equation \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr[(1-k)\\mu_S\\leq S \\leq(1+k)\\mu_S] \\geq p. \\end{equation*}\\] After subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr\\left[\\frac{-k\\mu_S}{\\sigma_S}\\leq (S-\\mu_S)/\\sigma_S \\leq \\frac{k\\mu_S}{\\sigma_S}\\right] \\geq p \\end{equation*}\\] . As done in the previous section the distribution for \\((S-\\mu_S)/\\sigma_S\\) is assumed to be normal and \\(k\\mu_S/\\sigma_S=y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((p+1)/2)\\). This equation can be rewritten as \\(\\mu_S^2=(y_p/k)^2\\sigma_S^2\\). Using the prior formulas for \\(\\mu_S\\) and \\(\\sigma_{S}^2\\) gives \\((\\mu_N\\mu_X)^2=(y_p/k)^2(\\mu_N\\sigma^{2}_X+\\mu^{2}_X\\sigma^{2}_N)\\). Dividing both sides by \\(\\mu_N\\mu_X^2\\) and reordering terms on the right side results in a full credibility standard \\(n_S\\) for aggregate losses \\[\\begin{equation} n_S=\\left(\\frac{y_p}{k}\\right)^2\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_N^2}{\\mu_N}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}\\right)^2\\right]=\\lambda_{kp}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_N^2}{\\mu_N}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}\\right)^2\\right]. \\tag{9.5} \\end{equation}\\] Example 9.2.5. The number of claims has a Poisson distribution. Individual loss amounts are independently and identically distributed with a Type II Pareto distribution \\(F(x)=1-[\\theta/(x+\\theta)]^{\\alpha}\\). The number of claims and loss amounts are independent. If observed aggregate losses should be within 5\\(\\%\\) of the expected value with probability \\(p=0.95\\), how many losses are required for full credibility? Show Example Solution Solution Because the number of claims is Poisson, \\((\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)=1\\). The mean of the Pareto is \\(\\mu_X=\\theta/(\\alpha-1)\\) and the variance is \\(\\sigma_X^2=\\theta^{2}\\alpha/[(\\alpha-1)^{2}(\\alpha-2)]\\) so \\((\\sigma_X/\\mu_X)^2=\\alpha/(\\alpha-2)\\). Combining the frequency and severity terms gives \\([(\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)+(\\sigma_X/\\mu_X)^2]=2(\\alpha-1)/(\\alpha-2)\\). From a normal table \\(y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((0.95+1)/2)=1.960\\). The full credibility standard is \\(n_S=(1.96/0.05)^{2}[2(\\alpha-1)/(\\alpha-2)]=3,073.28(\\alpha-1)/(\\alpha-2)\\). Suppose \\(\\alpha=3\\) then \\(n_S=6,146.56\\) for a full credibility standard of 6,147. Note that considerably more claims are needed for full credibility for aggregate losses than frequency alone. When the number of claims is Poisson distributed then equation (9.5) can be simplified using \\((\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)=1\\). It follows that \\([(\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N)+(\\sigma_X/\\mu_X)^2]=[1+(\\sigma_X/\\mu_X)^2]=[(\\mu_X^2+\\sigma_X^2)/\\mu_X^2]=\\mathrm{E}(X^2)/\\mathrm{E}(X)^2\\) using the relationship \\(\\mu_X^2+\\sigma_X^2=\\mathrm{E}(X^2)\\). The full credibility standard is \\(n_S=\\lambda_{kp}\\mathrm{E}(X^2)/\\mathrm{E}(X)^2\\). The pure premium \\(PP\\) is equal to aggregate losses \\(S\\) divided by exposures \\(m\\): \\(PP=S/m\\). The full credibility standard for pure premium will require \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr\\left[(1-k)\\mu_{PP}\\leq PP \\leq(1+k)\\mu_{PP}\\right] \\geq p. \\end{equation*}\\] The number of exposures \\(m\\) is assumed fixed and not a random variable so \\(\\mu_{PP}=\\mathrm{E}(S/m)=\\mathrm{E}(S)/m=\\mu_S/m\\). \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr\\left[(1-k)\\left(\\frac{\\mu_S}{m}\\right)\\leq \\left(\\frac{S}{m}\\right) \\leq(1+k)\\left(\\frac{\\mu_S}{m}\\right)\\right] \\geq p. \\end{equation*}\\] Multiplying through by exposures \\(m\\) returns the bounds for losses \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr[(1-k)\\mu_S\\leq S \\leq(1+k)\\mu_S] \\geq p. \\end{equation*}\\] This means that the full credibility standard \\(n_{PP}\\) for the pure premium is the same as that for aggregate losses \\[\\begin{equation*} n_{PP}=n_S=\\lambda_{kp}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_N^2}{\\mu_n}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}\\right)^2\\right]. \\end{equation*}\\] 9.2.3 Full Credibility for Severity Let \\(X\\) be a random variable representing the size of one claim. Claim severity is \\(\\mu_X=\\mathrm{E}(X)\\). Suppose that \\({X_1,X_2, \\ldots, X_n}\\) is a random sample of \\(n\\) claims that will be used to estimate claim severity \\(\\mu_X\\). The claims are assumed to be iid. The average value of the sample is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\left(X_1+X_2+\\cdots+X_n\\right). \\end{equation*}\\] How big does \\(n\\) need to be to get a good estimate? Note that \\(n\\) is not a random variable whereas it is in the aggregate loss model. In Section 9.2.1 the accuracy of an estimator for frequency was defined by requiring that the number of claims lie within a specified interval about the mean number of claims with a specified probability. For severity this requirement is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr[(1-k)\\mu_X\\leq \\bar{X} \\leq(1+k)\\mu_X ]\\geq p \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(k\\) and \\(p\\) need to be specified. Following the steps in Section 9.2.1, the mean claim severity \\(\\mu_X\\) is subtracted from each term and the standard deviation of the claim severity estimator \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}\\) is divided into each term yielding \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr\\left[\\frac{-k\\mu_X}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}}\\leq (\\bar{X}-\\mu_X)/\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} \\leq \\frac{k\\mu_X}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}}\\right] \\geq p \\end{equation*}\\] . As in prior sections, it is assumed that \\((\\bar{X}-\\mu_X)/\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}\\) is approximately normally distributed and the prior equation is satisfied if \\(k\\mu_X/\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}\\geq y_p\\) with \\(y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((p+1)/2)\\). Because \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the average of individual claims \\(X_1, X_2,\\dots, X_n\\), its standard deviation is equal to the standard deviation of an individual claim divided by \\(\\sqrt{n}\\): \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}=\\sigma_X/\\sqrt{n}\\). So, \\(k\\mu_X/(\\sigma_X/\\sqrt{n})\\geq y_p\\) and with a little algebra this can be rewritten as \\(n \\geq (y_p/k)^2(\\sigma_X/\\mu_X)^2\\). The full credibility standard for severity is \\[\\begin{equation} n_X=\\left(\\frac{y_p}{k}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}\\right)^2=\\lambda_{kp}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}\\right)^2. \\tag{9.6} \\end{equation}\\] Note that the term \\(\\sigma_X/\\mu_X\\) is the coefficient of variationStandard deviation divided by the mean of a distribution, to measure variability in terms of units of the mean for an individual claim. Even though \\(\\lambda_{kp}\\) is the full credibility standard for frequency given a Poisson distribution, there is no assumption about the distribution for the number of claims. Example 9.2.6. Individual loss amounts are independently and identically distributed with a Type II Pareto distribution \\(F(x)=1-[\\theta/(x+\\theta)]^{\\alpha}\\). How many claims are required for the average severity of observed claims to be within 5\\(\\%\\) of the expected severity with probability \\(p=0.95\\)? Show Example Solution Solution The mean of the Pareto is \\(\\mu_X=\\theta/(\\alpha-1)\\) and the variance is \\(\\sigma_X^2=\\theta^{2}\\alpha/[(\\alpha-1)^{2}(\\alpha-2)]\\) so \\((\\sigma_X/\\mu_X)^2=\\alpha/(\\alpha-2)\\). From a normal table \\(y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((0.95+1)/2)=1.960\\). The full credibility standard is \\(n_X=(1.96/0.05)^{2}[\\alpha/(\\alpha-2)]=1,536.64\\alpha/(\\alpha-2)\\). Suppose \\(\\alpha=3\\) then \\(n_X=4,609.92\\) for a full credibility standard of 4,610. 9.2.4 Partial Credibility In prior sections full credibility standards were calculated for estimating frequency (\\(n_f\\)), pure premium (\\(n_{PP}\\)), and severity (\\(n_X\\)) - in this section these full credibility standards will be denoted by \\(n_{0}\\). In each case the full credibility standard was the expected number of claims required to achieve a defined level of accuracy when using empirical data to estimate an expected value. If the observed number of claims is greater than or equal to the full credibility standard then a full credibility weight \\(Z=1\\) is given to the data. In limited fluctuation credibility, credibility weights \\(Z\\) assigned to data are \\[\\begin{equation*} Z=\\quad \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{n_{0}}} \\quad \\textrm{if} \\quad n &lt; n_{0} \\quad \\textrm{and} \\quad Z=\\quad 1 \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad n \\geq n_{0} \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(n_0\\) is the full credibility standard. The quantity \\(n\\) is the number of claims for the data that is used to estimate the expected frequency, severity, or pure premium. Example 9.2.7. The number of claims has a Poisson distribution. Individual loss amounts are independently and identically distributed with a Type II Pareto distribution \\(F(x)=1-[\\theta/(x+\\theta)]^{\\alpha}\\). Assume that \\(\\alpha=3\\). The number of claims and loss amounts are independent. The full credibility standard is that the observed pure premium should be within 5\\(\\%\\) of the expected value with probability \\(p=0.95\\). What credibility \\(Z\\) is assigned to a pure premium computed from 1,000 claims? Show Example Solution Solution Because the number of claims is Poisson, \\[ \\frac{\\mathrm{E}(X^2)}{[\\mathrm{E}~(X)]^2} =\\frac{\\sigma_N^2}{\\mu_N}+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}\\right)^2. \\] The mean of the Pareto is \\(\\mu_X=\\theta/(\\alpha-1)\\) and the second moment is \\(\\mathrm{E}(X^2)=2\\theta^{2}/[(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)]\\) so \\(\\mathrm{E}(X^2)/[\\mathrm{E}~(X)]^2=2(\\alpha-1)/(\\alpha-2)\\). From a normal table \\(y_p=\\Phi^{-1}((0.95+1)/2)=1.960\\). The full credibility standard is \\[n_{PP}=(1.96/0.05)^{2}[2(\\alpha-1)/(\\alpha-2)]=3,073.28(\\alpha-1)/(\\alpha-2)\\] and if \\(\\alpha=3\\) then \\(n_0=n_{PP}=6,146.56\\) or 6,147 if rounded up. The credibility assigned to 1,000 claims is \\(Z=(1,000/6,147)^{1/2}=0.40\\). Limited fluctuation credibility uses the formula \\(Z=\\sqrt{n/n_0}\\) to limit the fluctuation in the credibility-weighted estimate to match the fluctuation allowed for data with expected claims at the full credibility standard. Variance or standard deviation is used as the measure of fluctuation. Next we show an example to explain why the square-root formula is used. Suppose that average claim severity is being estimated from a sample of size \\(n\\) that is less than the full credibility standard \\(n_0=n_X\\). Applying credibility theory the estimate \\(\\hat{\\mu}_X\\) would be \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\mu}_X=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)M_X \\end{equation*}\\] with \\(\\bar{X}=(X_1+X_2+\\cdots+X_n)/n\\) and \\(iid\\) random variables \\(X_i\\) representing the sizes of individual claims. The complement of credibility is applied to \\(M_X\\) which could be last year’s estimated average severity adjusted for inflation, the average severity for a much larger pool of risks, or some other relevant quantity selected by the actuary. It is assumed that the variance of \\(M_X\\) is zero or negligible. With this assumption \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_X)=\\mathrm{Var}(Z\\bar{X})=Z^2\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X})=\\frac{n}{n_0}\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X}). \\end{equation*}\\] Because \\(\\bar{X}=(X_1+X_2+\\cdots+X_n)/n\\) it follows that \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X})=\\mathrm{Var}(X_i)/n\\) where random variable \\(X_i\\) is one claim. So, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_X)=\\frac{n}{n_0}\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X})=\\frac{n}{n_0}\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X_i)}{n}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X_i)}{n_0}. \\end{equation*}\\] The last term is exactly the variance of a sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) when the sample size is equal to the full credibility standard \\(n_0=n_X\\). Show Quiz Solution 9.3 Bühlmann Credibility In this section, you learn how to: Compute a credibility-weighted estimate for the expected loss for a risk or group of risks. Determine the credibility \\(Z\\) assigned to observations. Calculate the values required in Bühlmann credibility including the Expected Value of the Process Variance (EPV), Variance of the Hypothetical Means (VHM) and collective mean \\(\\mu\\). Recognize situations when the Bühlmann model is appropriate. A classification rating plan groups policyholders together into classes based on risk characteristics. Although policyholders within a class have similarities, they are not identical and their expected losses will not be exactly the same. An experience rating plan can supplement a class rating plan by credibility weighting an individual policyholder’s loss experience with the class rate to produce a more accurate rate for the policyholder. In the presentation of Buhlmann credibilityA credibility method that uses the amount of experience, expected value of the process variance, and variance of the hypothetical means to determine the credibility weight it is convenient to assign a risk parameterParameter in a distribution whose value reflects the risk categorization \\(\\theta\\) to each policyholder. Losses \\(X\\) for the policyholder will have a common distribution function \\(F_{\\theta}(x)\\) with mean \\(\\mu(\\theta)=\\mathrm{E}(X|\\theta)\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2(\\theta)=\\mathrm{Var}(X|\\theta)\\). Losses \\(X\\) can represent pure premiums, aggregate losses, number of claims, claim severities, or some other measure of loss for a period of time, often one year. Risk parameter \\(\\theta\\) may be continuous or discrete and may be multivariate depending on the model. If a policyholder with risk parameter \\(\\theta\\) had losses \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) during \\(n\\) time periods then the goal is to find E(\\(\\mu(\\theta)|X_1,\\ldots, X_n)\\), the conditional expectation of \\(\\mu(\\theta)\\) given \\(X_1,\\ldots, X_n\\). The Bühlmann credibility-weighted estimate for E(\\(\\mu(\\theta)|X_1,\\ldots, X_n)\\) for the policyholder is \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)\\mu \\tag{9.7} \\end{equation}\\] with \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\theta&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{a risk parameter that identifies a policyholder&#39;s risk level}\\\\ \\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{estimated expected loss for a policyholder with parameter }\\theta\\\\ &amp; &amp; \\textrm{and loss experience } \\bar{X}\\\\ \\bar{X}&amp;=&amp;(X_1+\\cdots+X_n)/n \\textrm{ is the average of $n$ observations of the policyholder } \\\\ Z&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{credibility assigned to $n$ observations } \\\\ \\mu&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{the expected loss for a randomly chosen policyholder in the class.}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] For a selected policyholder, random variables \\(X_j\\) are assumed to be iid for \\(j=1,\\ldots,n\\) because it is assumed that the policyholder’s exposure to loss is not changing through time. The quantity \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the average of \\(n\\) observations and \\(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta)=\\mathrm{E}(X_j|\\theta)=\\mu(\\theta)\\). If a policyholder is randomly chosen from the class and there is no loss information about the risk then the expected loss is \\(\\mu=\\mathrm{E}(\\mu(\\theta))\\) where the expectation is taken over all \\(\\theta\\)’s in the class. In this situation \\(Z=0\\) and the expected loss is \\(\\hat\\mu(\\theta)=\\mu\\) for the risk. The quantity \\(\\mu\\) can also be written as \\(\\mu=\\mathrm{E}(X_j)\\) or \\(\\mu=\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X})\\) and is often called the overall mean or collective meanThe mean estimate of a risk when no loss information about the risk is known. Note that E(\\(X_j\\)) is evaluated with the law of total expectationThe expected value of the conditional expected value of x given y is the same as the expected value of x: E(\\(X_j\\))=E(E(\\(X_j|\\theta)\\)). Example 9.3.1. The number of claims \\(X\\) for an insured in a class has a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\theta&gt;0\\). The risk parameter \\(\\theta\\) is exponentially distributed within the class with pdfProbability density function \\(f(\\theta)=e^{-\\theta}\\). What is the expected number of claims for an insured chosen at random from the class? Show Example Solution Solution Random variable \\(X\\) is Poisson with parameter \\(\\theta\\) and E\\((X|\\theta)=\\theta\\). The expected number of claims for a randomly chosen insured is \\(\\mu=\\mathrm{E}(\\mu(\\theta))=\\mathrm{E}(\\mathrm{E}(X|\\theta))=\\)E\\((\\theta)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\theta e^{-\\theta} d\\theta=1\\). In the prior example the risk parameter \\(\\theta\\) is a random variable with an exponential distribution. In the next example there are three types of risks and the risk parameter has a discrete distribution. Example 9.3.2. For any risk (policyholder) in a population the number of losses \\(N\\) in a year has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Individual loss amounts \\(X_i\\) for a risk are independent of \\(N\\) and are iid with Type II Pareto distribution \\(F(x)=1-[\\theta/(x+\\theta)]^{\\alpha}\\). There are three types of risks in the population as follows: \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Risk } &amp; \\text{Percentage} &amp; \\text{Poisson} &amp; \\text{Pareto} \\\\ \\text{Type} &amp; \\text{of Population} &amp; \\text{Parameter} &amp; \\text{Parameters} \\\\ \\hline A &amp; 50\\% &amp; \\lambda=0.5 &amp; \\theta=1000, \\alpha=2.0 \\\\ B &amp; 30\\% &amp; \\lambda=1.0 &amp; \\theta=1500, \\alpha=2.0 \\\\ C &amp; 20\\% &amp; \\lambda=2.0 &amp; \\theta=2000, \\alpha=2.0 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] If a risk is selected at random from the population, what is the expected aggregate loss in a year? Show Example Solution Solution The expected number of claims for a risk is E(\\(N|\\lambda\\))=\\(\\lambda\\). The expected value for a Pareto distributed random variable is E(\\(X | \\theta, \\alpha\\))=\\(\\theta/(\\alpha-1)\\). The expected value of the aggregate loss random variable \\(S=X_1+\\cdots+X_N\\) for a risk with parameters \\(\\lambda\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\theta\\) is E(\\(S\\))=E(\\(N\\))E(\\(X\\))=\\(\\lambda\\theta/(\\alpha-1)\\). The expected aggregate loss for a risk of type A is E(\\(S_{\\textrm{A}}\\))=(0.5)(1000)/(2-1)=500. The expected aggregate loss for a risk selected at random from the population is E(\\(S\\))=0.5[(0.5)(1000)]+0.3[(1.0)(1500)]+0.2[(2.0)(2000)]=1500. What is the risk parameter for a risk (policyholder) in the prior example? One could say that the risk parameter has three components \\((\\lambda,\\theta,\\alpha)\\) with possible values (0.5,1000,2.0), (1.0,1500,2.0), and (2.0,2000,2.0) depending on the type of risk. Note that in both of the examples the risk parameter is a random quantity with its own probability distribution. We do not know the value of the risk parameter for a randomly chosen risk. Although formula (9.7) was introduced using experience rating as an example, the Bühlmann credibility model has wider application. Suppose that a rating plan has multiple classes. Credibility formula (9.7) can be used to determine individual class rates. The overall mean \\(\\mu\\) would be the average loss for all classes combined, \\(\\bar{X}\\) would be the experience for the individual class, and \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)\\) would be the estimated loss for the class. 9.3.1 Credibility Z, EPV, and VHM When computing the credibility estimate \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)\\mu\\), how much weight \\(Z\\) should go to experience \\(\\bar{X}\\) and how much weight \\((1-Z)\\) to the overall mean \\(\\mu\\)? In Bühlmann credibility there are three factors that need to be considered: How much variation is there in a single observation \\(X_j\\) for a selected risk? With \\(\\bar{X}=(X_1+\\cdots+X_n)/n\\) and assuming that the observations are iid conditional on \\(\\theta\\), it follows that Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta)\\)=Var(\\(X_j|\\theta)/n\\). For larger Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta)\\) less credibility weight \\(Z\\) should be given to experience \\(\\bar{X}\\). The Expected Value of the Process VarianceAverage of the natural variability of observations from within each risk, abbreviated EPV, is the expected value of Var(\\(X_j|\\theta\\)) across all risks: \\[\\begin{equation*} EPV=\\mathrm{E}(\\mathrm{Var}(X_j|\\theta)). \\end{equation*}\\] Because Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta)\\)=Var(\\(X_j|\\theta)/n\\) it follows that E(Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta)\\))=EPV/\\(n\\). How homogeneous is the population of risks whose experience was combined to compute the overall mean \\(\\mu\\)? If all the risks are similar in loss potential then more weight \\((1-Z)\\) would be given to the overall mean \\(\\mu\\) because \\(\\mu\\) is the average for a group of similar risks whose means \\(\\mu(\\theta)\\) are not far apart. The homogeneity or heterogeneity of the population is measured by the Variance of the Hypothetical MeansVariance of the means across different classes, used to determine how similar or different the classes are from one another with abbreviation VHM: \\[\\begin{equation*} VHM=\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}(X_j|\\theta))=\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta)). \\end{equation*}\\] Note that we used \\(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta)=\\mathrm{E}(X_j|\\theta)\\) for the second equality. How many observations \\(n\\) were used to compute \\(\\bar{X}\\)? A larger sample would infer a larger \\(Z\\). Example 9.3.3. The number of claims \\(N\\) in a year for a risk in a population has a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\lambda&gt;0\\). The risk parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is uniformly distributed over the interval \\((0,2)\\). Calculate the EPV and VHM for the population. Show Example Solution Solution Random variable \\(N\\) is Poisson with parameter \\(\\lambda\\) so Var\\((N|\\lambda)=\\lambda\\). The Expected Value of the Process variance is EPV=E(Var(\\(N|\\lambda\\)))=E\\((\\lambda)=\\int_{0}^{2}\\lambda \\frac{1}{2} d\\lambda=1\\). The Variance of the Hypothetical Means is VHM=Var(E(N\\(|\\lambda\\)))= Var(\\(\\lambda\\))=E(\\(\\lambda^2)-(\\mathrm{E}(\\lambda))^2=\\int_{0}^{2}\\lambda^2 \\frac{1}{2} d\\lambda-(1)^2=\\frac{1}{3}\\). The Bühlmann credibility formula includes values for \\(n\\), EPV, and VHM: \\[\\begin{equation} Z=\\frac{n}{n+K} \\quad , \\quad K =\\frac{EPV}{VHM}. \\tag{9.8} \\end{equation}\\] If the VHM increases then \\(Z\\) increases. If the EPV increases then \\(Z\\) gets smaller. Unlike limited fluctuation credibility where \\(Z=1\\) when the expected number of claims is greater than the full credibility standard, \\(Z\\) can approach but not equal 1 as the number of observations \\(n\\) goes to infinity. If you multiply the numerator and denominator of the \\(Z\\) formula by (VHM/\\(n\\)) then \\(Z\\) can be rewritten as \\[\\begin{equation*} Z=\\frac{VHM}{VHM+(EPV/n)} . \\end{equation*}\\] The number of observations \\(n\\) is captured in the term (EPV/\\(n\\)). As shown in bullet (1) at the beginning of the section, E(Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta)\\))=EPV/\\(n\\). As the number of observations get larger, the expected variance of \\(\\bar{X}\\) gets smaller and credibility \\(Z\\) increases so that more weight gets assigned to \\(\\bar{X}\\) in the credibility-weighted estimate \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)\\). Example 9.3.4. Use the law of total variance to show that Var(\\(\\bar{X}\\)) = VHM + (EPV/n) and derive a formula for \\(Z\\) in terms of \\(\\bar{X}\\). Show Example Solution Solution The quantity Var(\\(\\bar{X}\\)) is called the unconditional variance or the total variance of \\(\\bar{X}\\). The law of total variance says \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X})=\\textrm{E(Var}(\\bar{X}|\\theta))+\\textrm{Var(E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta)). \\end{equation*}\\] In bullet (1) at the beginning of this section we showed E(Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta)\\))=EPV/\\(n\\). In the second bullet (2), Var(E(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta\\)))=VHM. Reordering the right hand side gives Var(\\(\\bar{X}\\))= VHM +(EPV/\\(n\\)). Another way to write the formula for credibility \\(Z\\) is \\(Z\\)=Var(E(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta\\)))/Var(\\(\\bar{X}\\)). This implies \\((1-Z)\\)=E(Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta\\)))/Var(\\(\\bar{X}\\)). The following long example and solution demonstrate how to compute the credibility-weighted estimate with frequency and severity data. Example 9.3.5. For any risk in a population the number of losses \\(N\\) in a year has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Individual loss amounts \\(X\\) for a selected risk are independent of \\(N\\) and are iid with exponential distribution \\(F(x)=1-e^{-x/\\beta}\\). There are three types of risks in the population as shown below. A risk was selected at random from the population and all losses were recorded over a five-year period. The total amount of losses over the five-year period was 5,000. Use Bühlmann credibility to estimate the annual expected aggregate loss for the risk. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Risk } &amp; \\text{Percentage} &amp; \\text{Poisson} &amp; \\text{Exponential} \\\\ \\text{Type} &amp; \\text{of Population} &amp; \\text{Parameter} &amp; \\text{Parameter} \\\\ \\hline A &amp; 50\\% &amp; \\lambda=0.5 &amp; \\beta=1000 \\\\ B &amp; 30\\% &amp; \\lambda=1.0 &amp; \\beta=1500 \\\\ C &amp; 20\\% &amp; \\lambda=2.0 &amp; \\beta=2000 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Show Example Solution Solution Because individual loss amounts \\(X\\) are exponentially distributed, E(\\(X| \\beta\\))=\\(\\beta\\) and Var(\\(X| \\beta\\))=\\(\\beta^2\\). For aggregate loss \\(S=X_1+\\cdots+X_N\\), the mean is E(\\(S\\))=E(\\(N\\))E(\\(X\\)) and process variance is Var(\\(S\\))=E(\\(N\\))Var(\\(X\\))+[E(\\(X\\))]\\(^2\\)Var(\\(N\\)). With Poisson frequency and exponentially distributed loss amounts, E(\\(S| \\lambda, \\beta\\))=\\(\\lambda\\beta\\) and Var(\\(S| \\lambda, \\beta\\)) = \\(\\lambda\\beta^2+\\beta^2\\lambda=2\\lambda\\beta^2\\). Population mean \\(\\mu\\): Risk means are \\(\\mu\\)(A)=0.5(1000)=500; \\(\\mu\\)(B)=1.0(1500)=1500; \\(\\mu\\)(C)=2.0(2000)=4000; and \\(\\mu\\)=0.50(500)+0.30(1500)+0.20(4000)=1,500. VHM: VHM=\\(0.50(500-1500)^2+0.30(1500-1500)^2+0.20(4000-1500)^2\\)=1,750,000. EPV: Process variances are \\(\\sigma^2(A)=2(0.5)(1000)^2=1,000,000\\); \\(\\sigma^2(B)=2(1.0)(1500)^2=4,500,000\\); \\(\\sigma^2(C)=2(2.0)(2000)^2=16,000,000\\); and EPV=0.50(1,000,000)+0.30(4,500,000)+0.20(16,000,000)=5,050,000. \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{X}}\\): \\(\\bar{X}_5=5,000/5\\)=1,000. \\(\\mathbf{K}\\): \\(K=5,050,000/1,750,000\\)=2.89. \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\): There are five years of observations so \\(n=5\\). \\(Z=5/(5+2.89)\\)=0.63. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)}\\): \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=0.63(1,000)+(1-0.63)1,500=\\boxed{\\mathbf{1,185.00}}\\). In real world applications of Bühlmann credibility the value of \\(K=EPV/VHM\\) must be estimated. Sometimes a value for \\(K\\) is selected using judgment. A smaller \\(K\\) makes estimator \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)\\) more responsive to actual experience \\(\\bar{X}\\) whereas a larger \\(K\\) produces a more stable estimate by giving more weight to \\(\\mu\\). Judgment may be used to balance responsiveness and stability. A later section in this chapter will discuss methods for determining \\(K\\) from data. For a policyholder with risk parameter \\(\\theta\\), Bühlmann credibility uses a linear approximation \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)\\mu\\) to estimate E(\\(\\mu(\\theta)|X_1,\\ldots,X_n\\)), the expected loss for the policyholder given prior losses \\(X_1,\\ldots, X_n\\). We can rewrite this as \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=a+b\\bar{X}\\) which makes it obvious that the credibility estimate is a linear function of \\(\\bar{X}\\). If E(\\(\\mu(\\theta)|X_1,\\ldots,X_n\\)) is approximated by the linear function \\(a+b\\bar{X}\\) and constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are chosen so that E[(E(\\(\\mu(\\theta)|X_1,\\ldots,X_n)-(a+b\\bar{X}))^2\\)] is minimized, what are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? The answer is \\(b=n/(n+K)\\) and \\(a=(1-b)\\mu\\) with \\(K=EPV/VHM\\) and \\(\\mu=E(\\mu(\\theta))\\). More details can be found in references (Bühlmann 1967), (Bühlmann and Gisler 2005), (Klugman, Panjer, and Willmot 2012), and (Tse 2009). Bühlmann credibility is also called least-squares credibility, greatest accuracy credibility, or Bayesian credibility. Show Quiz Solution 9.4 Bühlmann-Straub Credibility In this section, you learn how to: Compute a credibility-weighted estimate for the expected loss for a risk or group of risks using the Bühlmann-Straub model. Determine the credibility \\(Z\\) assigned to observations. Calculate required values including the Expected Value of the Process Variance (EPV), Variance of the Hypothetical Means (VHM) and collective mean \\(\\mu\\). Recognize situations when the Bühlmann-Straub model is appropriate. With standard Bühlmann or least-squares credibility as described in the prior section, losses \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_n\\) arising from a selected policyholder are assumed to be iid. If the subscripts indicate year 1, year 2 and so on up to year \\(n\\), then the iid assumption means that the policyholder has the same exposure to loss every year. For commercial insurance this assumption is frequently violated. Consider a commercial policyholder that uses a fleet of vehicles in its business. In year 1 there are \\(m_1\\) vehicles in the fleet, \\(m_2\\) vehicles in year 2, .., and \\(m_n\\) vehicles in year \\(n\\). The exposure to loss from ownership and use of this fleet is not constant from year to year. The annual losses for the fleet are not iid. Define \\(Y_{jk}\\) to be the loss for the \\(k^{th}\\) vehicle in the fleet for year \\(j\\). Then, the total losses for the fleet in year \\(j\\) are \\(Y_{j1}+\\cdots+Y_{jm_j}\\) where we are adding up the losses for each of the \\(m_j\\) vehicles. In the Bühlmann-Straub model it is assumed that random variables \\(Y_{jk}\\) are iid across all vehicles and years for the policyholder. With this assumption the means E(\\(Y_{jk}|\\theta)=\\mu(\\theta)\\) and variances Var(\\(Y_{jk}|\\theta)=\\sigma^2(\\theta)\\) are the same for all vehicles and years. The quantity \\(\\mu(\\theta)\\) is the expected loss and \\(\\sigma^2(\\theta)\\) is the variance in the loss for one year for one vehicle for a policyholder with risk parameter \\(\\theta\\). If \\(X_j\\) is the average loss per unit of exposure in year \\(j\\), \\(X_j=(Y_{j1}+\\cdots+Y_{jm_j})/m_j\\), then E(\\(X_j|\\theta)=\\mu(\\theta)\\) and Var(\\(X_j|\\theta)=\\sigma^2(\\theta)/m_j\\) for policyholder with risk parameter \\(\\theta\\). Note that we used the fact that the \\(Y_{jk}\\) are iid for a given policyholder. The average loss per vehicle for the entire \\(n\\)-year period is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\bar{X}= \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j X_{j} \\quad , \\quad m=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j. \\end{equation*}\\] It follows that E\\((\\bar{X}|\\theta)=\\mu(\\theta)\\) and Var\\((\\bar{X}|\\theta)=\\sigma^2(\\theta)/m\\) where \\(\\mu(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sigma^2(\\theta)\\) are the mean and variance for a single vehicle for one year for the policyholder. Example 9.4.1. Prove that Var\\((\\bar{X}|\\theta)=\\sigma^2(\\theta)/m\\) for a risk with risk parameter \\(\\theta\\). Show Example Solution Solution \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X}|\\theta)&amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j X_j|\\theta \\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}(m_j X_{j}|\\theta)=\\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X_j|\\theta)\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j^2 (\\sigma^2(\\theta)/m_j)=\\frac{\\sigma^2(\\theta)}{m^2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j=\\sigma^2(\\theta)/m.\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The Buhlmann-Straub credibilityAn extension of the buhlmann credibility model that allows for varying exposure by year estimate is: \\[\\begin{equation}\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)\\mu \\tag{9.9} \\end{equation}\\] with \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\theta&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{a risk parameter that identifies a policyholder&#39;s risk level}\\\\ \\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{estimated expected loss for one exposure for the policyholder}\\\\ &amp; &amp; \\textrm{with loss experience } \\bar{X}\\\\ \\bar{X}&amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j X_j \\textrm{ is the average loss per exposure for $m$ exposures.}\\\\ &amp; &amp; \\textrm{$X_j$ is the average loss per exposure and $m_j$ is the number of exposures in year $j$.} \\\\ Z&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{credibility assigned to $m$ exposures } \\\\ \\mu&amp;=&amp;\\textrm{expected loss for one exposure for randomly chosen}\\\\ &amp; &amp; \\textrm{ policyholder from population.}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)\\) is the estimator for the expected loss for one exposure. If the policyholder has \\(m_j\\) exposures then the expected loss is \\(m_j\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)\\). In an example in the prior section it was shown that \\(Z\\)=Var(E(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta\\)))/Var(\\(\\bar{X}\\)) where \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the average loss for \\(n\\) observations. In equation (9.9) the \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the average loss for \\(m\\) exposures and the same \\(Z\\) formula can be used: \\[ Z=\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta))}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X})}= \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta))}{\\mathrm{E}(\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X}|\\theta))+\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta))}. \\] The denominator was expanded using the law of total varianceA decomposition of the variance of a random variable into conditional components. specifically, for random variables x and y on the same probability space, var(x) = e[var(y|x)] + var[e(x|y)].. As noted above \\(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta)=\\mu(\\theta)\\) so \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}|\\theta))=\\mathrm{Var}(\\mu(\\theta))=VHM\\). Because Var\\((\\bar{X}|\\theta)=\\sigma^2(\\theta)/m\\) it follows that E(Var(\\(\\bar{X}|\\theta\\)))=E(\\(\\sigma^2(\\theta))/m\\)=EPV/m. Making these substitutions and a little algebra gives \\[\\begin{equation} Z=\\frac{m}{m+K} \\quad , \\quad K =\\frac{EPV}{VHM}. \\tag{9.10} \\end{equation}\\] This is the same \\(Z\\) as for Bühlmann credibility except number of exposures \\(m\\) replaces number of years or observations \\(n\\). Example 9.4.2. A commercial automobile policyholder had the following exposures and claims over a three-year period: \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Year} &amp; \\text{Number of Vehicles} &amp; \\text{Number of Claims} \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 9 &amp; 5 \\\\ 2 &amp; 12 &amp; 4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 15 &amp; 4 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] The number of claims in a year for each vehicle in the policyholder’s fleet is Poisson distributed with the same mean (parameter) \\(\\lambda\\). Parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is distributed among the policyholders in the population with pdf \\(f(\\lambda)=6\\lambda(1-\\lambda)\\) with \\(0&lt;\\lambda&lt;1\\). The policyholder has 18 vehicles in its fleet in year 4. Use Bühlmann-Straub credibility to estimate the expected number of policyholder claims in year 4. Show Example Solution Solution The expected number of claims for one vehicle for a randomly chosen policyholder is \\(\\mu=\\mathrm{E}(\\lambda)=\\int_{0}^{1} \\lambda[6\\lambda(1-\\lambda)] d\\lambda=1/2\\). The average number of claims per vehicle for the policyholder is \\(\\bar{X}\\)=13/36. The Expected Value of the Process Variance for a single vehicle is EPV=E(\\(\\lambda)=1/2\\). The Variance of the Hypothetical Means across policyholders is VHM=Var(\\(\\lambda\\))=E(\\(\\lambda^2\\))-\\((\\mathrm{E}(\\lambda))^2=\\int_{0}^{1} \\lambda^2[6\\lambda(1-\\lambda)] d\\lambda-(1/2)^2=(3/10)-(1/4)=(6/20)-(5/20)=1/20\\). So, \\(K\\)=EPV/VHM=(1/2)/(1/20)=10. The number of exposures in the experience period is \\(m=9+12+15=36\\). The credibility is \\(Z=36/(36+10)=18/23\\). The credibility-weighted estimate for the number of claims for one vehicle is \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)\\mu\\)=(18/23)(13/36)+(5/23)(1/2)=9/23. With 18 vehicles in the fleet in year 4 the expected number of claims is 18(9/23)=162/23=7.04 . 9.5 Bayesian Inference and Bühlmann Credibility In this section, you learn how to: Use Bayes Theorem to determine a formula for the expected loss of a risk given a likelihood and prior distribution. Determine the posterior distributions for the Gamma-Poisson and Beta-Binomial Bayesian models and compute expected values. Understand the connection between the Bühlmann and Bayesian estimates for the Gamma-Poisson and Beta-Binomial models. Section 4.4 reviews Bayesian inferenceA branch of statistics that leverages bayes theorem to update the distribution as more experience becomes available and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with that material. The reader is also advised to read the Bühlmann credibility section in this chapter. This section will compare Bayesian inference with Bühlmann credibility and show connections between the two models. A risk with risk parameter \\(\\theta\\) has expected loss \\(\\mu(\\theta)=E(X|\\theta)\\) with random variable \\(X\\) representing pure premium, aggregate loss, number of claims, claim severity, or some other measure of loss during a period of time. If the risk has \\(n\\) losses \\(X_1,\\ldots, X_n\\) during n separate periods of time, then these losses are assumed to be \\(iid\\) for the policyholder and \\(\\mu(\\theta)=E(X_i|\\theta)\\) for \\(i=1,..,n\\). If the risk had \\(n\\) losses \\(x_1,\\ldots, x_n\\) then E(\\(\\mu(\\theta)|x_1,\\ldots, x_n)\\) is the conditional expectation of \\(\\mu(\\theta)\\). The Bühlmann credibility formula \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta)=Z\\bar{X}+(1-Z)\\mu\\) is a linear function of \\(\\bar{X}=(x_1+\\cdots+x_n)/n\\) used to estimate \\(E(\\mu(\\theta)|x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\). The expectation \\(E(\\mu(\\theta)|x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) can be calculated from the conditional density function \\(f(x|\\theta)\\) and the posterior distribution \\(\\pi(\\theta|x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{E}(\\mu(\\theta)|x_1,\\ldots,x_n)&amp;=&amp;\\int \\mu(\\theta) \\pi(\\theta|x_1,\\ldots,x_n) d\\theta \\\\ \\mu(\\theta)&amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{E}(X|\\theta)=\\int xf(x|\\theta) dx .\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The posterior distribution comes from Bayes theoremA probability law that expresses conditional probability of the event a given the event b in terms of the conditional probability of the event b given the event a and the unconditional probability of a \\[\\begin{equation*} \\pi(\\theta|x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{n} f(x_j|\\theta)}{f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)}\\pi({\\theta}). \\end{equation*}\\] The conditional density function \\(f(x|\\theta)\\) and the prior distribution \\(\\pi(\\theta)\\) must be specified. The numerator \\(\\prod_{j=1}^{n} f(x_j|\\theta)\\) on the right-hand side is called the likelihood. The denominator \\(f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is the joint density function for \\(n\\) losses \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\). 9.5.1 Gamma-Poisson Model In the Gamma-Poisson modelA statistical model that assumes the frequency of claims is poisson whose mean has a prior distribution that is a gamma distribution the number of claims \\(X\\) has a Poisson distribution Pr(\\(X=x|\\lambda)=\\lambda^xe^{-\\lambda}/x!\\) for a risk with risk parameter \\(\\lambda\\). The prior distribution for \\(\\lambda\\) is gamma with \\(\\pi(\\lambda)=\\beta^\\alpha\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}e^{-\\beta\\lambda}/\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\). (Note that a rate parameter \\(\\beta\\) is being used in the gamma distribution rather than a scale parameter.) The mean of the gamma is E(\\(\\lambda)=\\alpha/\\beta\\) and the variance is Var(\\(\\lambda)=\\alpha/\\beta^2\\). In this section we will assume that \\(\\lambda\\) is the expected number of claims per year though we could have chosen another time interval. If a risk is selected at random from the population then the expected number of claims in a year is E(\\(N\\))=E(E(\\(N|\\lambda\\)))=E(\\(\\lambda\\))=\\(\\alpha/\\beta\\). If we had no observations for the selected risk then the expected number of claims for the risk is \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\). During \\(n\\) years the following number of claims by year was observed for the randomly selected risk: \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\). From Bayes theorem the posterior distribution is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\pi(\\lambda|x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{n} (\\lambda^{x_j}e^{-\\lambda}/x_j!)}{\\Pr(X_1=x_1,\\ldots,X_n=x_n)}\\beta^\\alpha\\lambda^{\\alpha-1}e^{-\\beta\\lambda}/\\Gamma(\\alpha). \\end{equation*}\\] Combining terms that have a \\(\\lambda\\) and putting all other terms into constant \\(C\\) gives \\[\\begin{equation*} \\pi(\\lambda|x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=C\\lambda^{(\\alpha+\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j)-1}e^{-(\\beta+n)\\lambda}. \\end{equation*}\\] This is a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha&#39;=\\alpha+\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j\\) and \\(\\beta&#39;=\\beta+n\\). The constant must be \\(C={\\beta&#39;}^{\\alpha&#39;}/\\Gamma(\\alpha&#39;)\\) so that \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\pi(\\lambda|x_1,\\ldots,x_n) d\\lambda=1\\) though we do not need to know \\(C\\). As explained in chapter four the gamma distribution is a conjugate prior for the Poisson distribution so the posterior distribution is also gamma. Because the posterior distribution is gamma the expected number of claims for the selected risk is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{E}(\\lambda|x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\frac{\\alpha+\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j}{\\beta+n}=\\frac{\\alpha + \\textrm{number of claims}}{\\beta+\\textrm{number of years}}. \\end{equation*}\\] This formula is slightly different from chapter four because parameter \\(\\beta\\) is multiplied by \\(\\lambda\\) in the exponential of the gamma pdf whereas in chapter four \\(\\lambda\\) is divided by parameter \\(\\theta\\). We have chosen this form for the exponential to simplify the equation for the expected number of claims. Now we will compute the Bühlmann credibility estimate for the Gamma-Poisson model. The variance for a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(\\lambda\\) so EPV=E(Var(\\(X|\\lambda\\)))=E(\\(\\lambda\\))=\\(\\alpha/\\beta\\). The mean number of claims per year for the risk is \\(\\lambda\\) so VHM=Var(E(\\(X|\\lambda\\)))=Var(\\(\\lambda\\))=\\(\\alpha/\\beta^2\\). The credibility parameter is \\(K\\)=EPV/VHM=\\((\\alpha/\\beta)/(\\alpha/\\beta^2)=\\beta\\). The overall mean is E(E(\\(X|\\lambda\\)))=E(\\(\\lambda\\))=\\(\\alpha/\\beta\\). The sample mean is \\(\\bar{X}=(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j)/n\\). The credibility-weighted estimate for the expected number of claims for the risk is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{n}{n+\\beta}\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j}{n} +(1-\\frac{n}{n+\\beta})\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}=\\frac{\\alpha+\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j}{\\beta+n}. \\end{equation*}\\] For the Gamma-Poisson model the Bühlmann credibility estimate matches the Bayesian analysis result. 9.5.2 Beta-Binomial Model The Beta-Binomial modelA statistical model for modeling the probability of an event using the binomial distribution with a probability that has a prior distribution from a beta distribution is useful for modeling the probability of an event. Assume that random variable \\(X\\) is the number of successes in \\(n\\) trials and that \\(X\\) has a binomial distribution Pr(\\(X=x|p)=\\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\\). In the Beta-Binomial model the prior distribution for probability \\(p\\) is a beta distribution with pdf \\[\\begin{equation*} \\pi(p)=\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}p^{\\alpha-1}(1-p)^{\\beta-1} , \\quad 0&lt;p&lt;1, \\alpha&gt;0, \\beta&gt;0. \\end{equation*}\\] The posterior distribution for \\(p\\) given an outcome of \\(x\\) successes in \\(n\\) trials is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\pi(p|x)=\\frac{\\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}}{\\Pr(x)}\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}p^{\\alpha-1}(1-p)^{\\beta-1}. \\end{equation*}\\] Combining terms that have a \\(p\\) and putting everything else into the constant \\(C\\) yields \\[\\begin{equation*} \\pi(p| x)=Cp^{\\alpha+x-1}(1-p)^{\\beta+(n-x)-1}. \\end{equation*}\\] This is a beta distribution with new parameters \\(\\alpha^\\prime=\\alpha+x\\) and \\(\\beta^\\prime=\\beta+(n-x)\\). The constant must be \\[\\begin{equation*} C=\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta+n)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+x)\\Gamma(\\beta+n-x)}. \\end{equation*}\\] The mean for the beta distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) is E(\\(p)=\\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)\\). Given \\(x\\) successes in \\(n\\) trials in the Beta-Binomial model the mean of the posterior distribution is \\[\\begin{equation*} E(p|x)=\\frac{\\alpha+x}{\\alpha+\\beta+n}. \\end{equation*}\\] As the number of trials \\(n\\) and successes \\(x\\) increase, the expected value of \\(p\\) approaches \\(x/n\\). The Bühlmann credibility estimate for E(\\(p|x\\)) is exactly as the same as the Bayesian estimate as demonstrated in the following example. Example 9.5.1 The probability that a coin toss will yield heads is \\(p\\). The prior distribution for probability \\(p\\) is beta with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). On \\(n\\) tosses of the coin there were exactly \\(x\\) heads. Use Bühlmann credibility to estimate the expected value of \\(p\\). Show Example Solution Solution Define random variables \\(Y_j\\) such that \\(Y_j=1\\) if the \\(j^{th}\\) coin toss is heads and \\(Y_j=0\\) if tails for \\(j=1,\\ldots, n\\). Random variables \\(Y_j\\) are iid conditional on \\(p\\) with Pr\\([Y=1|p]=p\\) and Pr\\([Y=0|p]=1-p\\) The number of heads in \\(n\\) tosses can be represented by the random variable \\(X=Y_1+\\cdots+Y_n\\). We want to estimate \\(p=E[Y_j]\\) using Bühlmann credibility: \\(\\hat{p} = Z\\bar{Y} +(1-Z)\\mu\\). The overall mean is \\(\\mu=E(E(Y_j|p))=E(p)=\\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)\\). The sample mean is \\(\\bar{y}=x/n\\). The credibility is \\(Z=n/(n+K)\\) and K=EPV/VHM. With Var\\((Y_j|p)=p(1-p)\\) it follows that EPV=E(Var\\((Y_j|p)\\))=E(\\(p(1-p)\\)). Because E\\((Y_j|p)=p\\) then VHM=Var\\((E(Y_j|p))\\)=Var(\\(p\\)). For the beta distribution \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{E}(p)=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}, \\mathrm{E}(p^2)=\\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)}{(\\alpha+\\beta)(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}, \\textrm{ and } \\mathrm{Var}(p)=\\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha+\\beta)^2(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}. \\end{equation*}\\] Parameter \\(K\\)=EPV/VHM=[E(\\(p\\))-E(\\(p^2\\))]/Var(\\(p\\)). With some algebra this reduces to \\(K=\\alpha+\\beta\\). The Bühlmann credibility-weighted estimate is \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{p} &amp;= \\frac{n}{n+\\alpha+\\beta}\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)+\\left(1-\\frac{n}{n+\\alpha+\\beta}\\right)\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\\\ \\hat{p} &amp; =\\frac{\\alpha+x}{\\alpha+\\beta+n}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] which is the same as the Bayesian posterior mean. 9.5.3 Exact Credibility As demonstrated in the prior section, the Bühlmann credibility estimates for the Gamma-Poisson and Beta-Binomial models exactly match the Bayesian analysis results. The term exact credibilityA situation where the bayesian credibility estimate matches that of the buhlmann credibility estimate is applied in these situations. Exact credibility may occur if the probability distribution for \\(X_j\\) is in the linear exponential family and the prior distribution is a conjugate prior. Besides these two models, examples of exact credibility also include Gamma-Exponential and Normal-Normal models. It is also noteworthy that if the conditional mean E\\((\\mu(\\theta)|X_1,...,X_n)\\) is linear in the past observations, then the Bühlmann credibility estimate will coincide with the Bayesian estimate. More information about exact credibility can be found in (Bühlmann and Gisler 2005), (Klugman, Panjer, and Willmot 2012), and (Tse 2009). 9.6 Estimating Credibility Parameters In this section, you learn how to: Perform nonparametric estimation with the Bühlmann and Bühlmann-Straub credibility models. Identify situations when semiparametric estimation is appropriate. Use data to approximate the EPV and VHM. Balance credibility-weighted estimates. The examples in this chapter have provided assumptions for calculating credibility parameters. In actual practice the actuary must use real world data and judgment to determine credibility parameters. 9.6.1 Full Credibility Standard for Limited Fluctuation Credibility Limited-fluctuation credibility requires a full credibility standard. The general formula for aggregate losses or pure premium, as obtained in formula (9.5), is \\[\\begin{equation*} n_S=\\left(\\frac{y_p}{k}\\right)^2\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_N^2}{\\mu_N}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}\\right)^2\\right] \\end{equation*}\\] with \\(N\\) representing number of claims and \\(X\\) the size of claims. If one assumes \\(\\sigma_X=0\\) then the full credibility standard for frequency results. If \\(\\sigma_N=0\\) then the full credibility formula for severity follows. Probability \\(p\\) and \\(k\\) value are often selected using judgment and experience. In practice it is often assumed that the number of claims is Poisson distributed so that \\(\\sigma_N^2/\\mu_N=1\\). In this case the formula can be simplified to \\[\\begin{equation*} n_S=\\left(\\frac{y_p}{k}\\right)^2\\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{E}(X^2)}{(\\mathrm{E}(X))^2}\\right]. \\end{equation*}\\] An empirical mean and second moment for the sizes of individual claim losses can be computed from past data, if available. 9.6.2 Nonparametric Estimation for Bühlmann and Bühlmann-Straub Models Bayesian analysis as described previously requires assumptions about a prior distribution and likelihood. It is possible to produce estimates without these assumptions and these methods are often referred to as empirical Bayes methodsCredibility methods that estimate the credibility weight without using any assumptions about prior distributions or likelihoods, instead relying only on empirical data. Bühlmann and Bühlmann-Straub credibility with parameters estimated from the data are included in the category of empirical Bayes methods. Bühlmann Model First we will address the simpler Bühlmann model. Assume that there are \\(r\\) risks in a population. For risk \\(i\\) with risk parameter \\(\\theta_i\\) the losses for \\(n\\) periods are \\(X_{i1},\\ldots, X_{in}\\). The losses for a given risk are iid across periods as assumed in the Bühlmann model. For risk \\(i\\) the sample mean is \\(\\bar{X}_i=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_{ij}/n\\) and the unbiased sample process variance is \\(s_i^2=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(X_{ij}-\\bar{X}_i)^2/(n-1)\\). An unbiased estimator for the EPV can be calculated by taking the average of \\(s_i^2\\) for the \\(r\\) risks in the population: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{EPV}=\\frac{1}{r}\\sum_{i=1}^{r} s_i^2 = \\frac{1}{r(n-1)} \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\sum_{j=1}^{n}(X_{ij}-\\bar{X}_i)^2 . \\tag{9.11} \\end{equation}\\] The individual risk means \\(\\bar{X}_i\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots, r\\) can be used to estimate the VHM. An unbiased estimator of Var(\\(\\bar{X}_i\\)) is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\bar{X}_i)=\\frac{1}{r-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{r}(\\bar{X}_i-\\bar{X})^2 \\textrm{ and } \\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{r}\\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\bar{X}_i, \\end{equation*}\\] but Var(\\(\\bar{X}_i\\)) is not the VHM. The total variance formula or unconditional variance formula is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X}_i)=\\textrm{E(Var}(\\bar{X}_i|\\Theta=\\theta_i))+\\textrm{Var(E}(\\bar{X}_i|\\Theta=\\theta_i)). \\end{equation*}\\] The VHM is the second term on the right because \\(\\mu(\\theta_i)=\\mathrm{E}(\\bar{X}_i|\\Theta=\\theta_i)\\) is the hypothetical mean for risk \\(i\\). So, \\[\\begin{equation*} VHM=\\textrm{Var(E}(\\mu(\\theta_i)) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{X}_i) - \\textrm{E(Var}(\\bar{X}_i|\\Theta=\\theta_i)). \\end{equation*}\\] As discussed previously in Section 9.3.1, EPV/n = E(Var(\\(\\bar{X}_i|\\Theta=\\theta_i\\))) and using the above estimators gives an unbiased estimator for the VHM: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{VHM} = \\frac{1}{r-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{r}(\\bar{X}_i-\\bar{X})^2 - \\frac{\\widehat{EPV}}{n} . \\tag{9.12} \\end{equation}\\] Although the expected loss for a risk with parameter \\(\\theta_i\\) is \\(\\mu(\\theta_i)\\)=E(\\(\\bar{X}_i|\\Theta=\\theta_i\\)), the variance of the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}_i\\) is greater than or equal to the variance of the hypothetical means: Var(\\(\\bar{X}_i)\\geq\\)Var(\\(\\mu(\\theta_i)\\)). The variance in the sample means Var(\\(\\bar{X}_i\\)) includes both the variance in the hypothetical means plus a process variance term. In some cases formula (9.12) can produce a negative value for \\(\\widehat{VHM}\\) because of the subtraction of \\(\\widehat{EPV}/n\\), but a variance cannot be negative. The process variance within risks is so large that it overwhelms the measurement of the variance in means between risks. In this case we cannot use this method to determine the values needed for Bühlmann credibility. Example 9.6.1. Two policyholders had claims over a three-year period as shown in the table below.

Bühlmann-Straub Model Empirical formulas for EPV and VHM in the Bühlmann-Straub model are more complicated because a risk’s number of exposures can change from one period to another. Also, the number of experience periods does not have to be constant across the population. First some definitions: \\(X_{ij}\\) is the losses per exposure for risk \\(i\\) in period \\(j\\). Losses can refer to number of claims or amount of loss. There are \\(r\\) risks so \\(i=1,\\ldots,r\\). \\(n_i\\) is the number of observation periods for risk \\(i\\) \\(m_{ij}\\) is the number of exposures for risk \\(i\\) in period \\(j\\) for \\(j=1,\\ldots,n_i\\) Risk \\(i\\) with risk parameter \\(\\theta_i\\) has \\(m_{ij}\\) exposures in period \\(j\\) which means that the losses per exposure random variable can be written as \\(X_{ij}=(Y_{i1}+\\cdots+Y_{im_{ij}})/m_{ij}\\). Random variable \\(Y_{ik}\\) is the loss for one exposure. For risk \\(i\\) losses \\(Y_{ik}\\) are iid with mean E(\\(Y_{ik}\\))=\\(\\mu(\\theta_i)\\) and process variance Var(\\(Y_{ik}\\))=\\(\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)\\). It follows that Var(\\(X_{ij})\\)=\\(\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)/m_{ij}\\). Two more important definitions are: \\(\\bar{X}_i=\\frac{1}{m_i}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} m_{ij}X_{ij}\\) with \\(m_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} m_{ij}\\). \\(\\bar{X}_i\\) is the average loss per exposure for risk \\(i\\) for all observation periods combined. \\(\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{r} m_i \\bar{X}_i\\) with \\(m=\\sum_{i=1}^r m_i\\). \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the average loss per exposure for all risks for all observation periods combined. An unbiased estimator for the process variance \\(\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)\\) of one exposure for risk \\(i\\) is \\[\\begin{equation*} {s_i}^2=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} m_{ij}(X_{ij}-\\bar{X}_i)^2}{n_i-1}. \\end{equation*}\\] The weights \\(m_{ij}\\) are applied to the squared differences because the \\(X_{ij}\\) are the averages of \\(m_{ij}\\) exposures. The weighted average of the sample variances \\({s_i}^2\\) for each risk \\(i\\) in the population with weights proportional to the number of \\((n_i-1)\\) observation periods will produce the expected value of the process variance (EPV) estimate \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{EPV}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^r (n_i-1){s_i}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^r (n_i-1)}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^r \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} m_{ij}(X_{ij}-\\bar{X}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^r (n_i-1)}. \\end{equation*}\\] The quantity \\(\\widehat{EPV}\\) is an unbiased estimator for the expected value of the process variance of one exposure for a risk chosen at random from the population. To calculate an estimator for the variance in the hypothetical means (VHM) the squared differences of the individual risk sample means \\(\\bar{X}_i\\) and population mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) are used. An unbiased estimator for the VHM is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{VHM}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^r m_i(\\bar{X}_i-\\bar{X})^2 - (r-1)\\widehat{EPV}}{m-\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^r m_i^2}. \\end{equation*}\\] This complicated formula is necessary because of the varying number of exposures. Proofs that the EPV and VHM estimators shown above are unbiased can be found in several references mentioned at the end of this chapter including (Bühlmann and Gisler 2005), (Klugman, Panjer, and Willmot 2012), and (Tse 2009).

Assuming that the \\(X_{ij}\\) have a particular distribution and using properties of the distribution along with the data to determine credibility parameters is referred to as semiparametric estimationCredibility method that assumes a distribution for the loss per exposure random variable and otherwise uses empirical data. An example of semiparametric estimation would be the assumption of a Poisson distribution when estimating claim frequencies. The Poisson distribution has the property that the mean and variance are identical and this property can simplify calculations. The following simple example comes from the prior section but now includes a Poisson assumption about claim frequencies. Example 9.6.4. Two policyholders had claims over a three-year period as shown in the table below. Assume that the number of claims for each risk has a Poisson distribution. Estimate the expected number of claims for each policyholder using Bühlmann credibility and calculating necessary parameters from the data. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Year} &amp; \\text{Risk A} &amp; \\text{Risk B} \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Show Example Solution Solution \\(\\bar{x}_A=\\frac{1}{3}(0+1+0)=\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(\\bar{x}_B=\\frac{1}{3}(2+1+2)=\\frac{5}{3}\\) \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{5}{3})=1\\) With Poisson assumption the estimated variance for risk A is \\(\\hat\\sigma_A^2=\\bar{x}_A=\\frac{1}{3}\\) Similarly, \\(\\hat\\sigma_B^2=\\bar{x}_B=\\frac{5}{3}\\) \\(\\widehat{EPV}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{3})+\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{5}{3})=1\\). This is also \\(\\bar{x}\\) because of Poisson assumption. \\(\\widehat{VHM}=\\frac{1}{2-1}\\left[(\\frac{1}{3}-1)^2+(\\frac{5}{3}-1)^2\\right]-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{5}{9}\\) \\(K=\\frac{1}{5/9}=\\frac{9}{5}\\) \\(Z_A=Z_B=\\frac{3}{3+(9/5)}=\\frac{5}{8}\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}_A=\\frac{5}{8}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+(1-\\frac{5}{8})1=\\frac{7}{12}\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}_B=\\frac{5}{8}\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)+(1-\\frac{5}{8})1=\\frac{17}{12}.\\) Although we assumed that the number of claims for each risk was Poisson distributed in the prior example, we did not need this additional assumption because there was enough information to use nonparametric estimation. In fact, the Poisson assumption might not be appropriate because for risk B the sample mean is not equal to the sample variance: \\(\\bar{x}_B=\\frac{5}{3}\\neq s_B^2=\\frac{1}{3}\\). The following example is commonly used to demonstrate a situation where semiparametric estimation is needed. There is insufficient information for nonparametric estimation but with the Poisson assumption, estimates can be calculated. Example 9.6.5. A portfolio of 2,000 policyholders generated the following claims profile during a five-year period: \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Number of Claims} &amp; \\\\ \\text{In 5 Years} &amp; \\text{Number of policies}\\\\ \\hline 0 &amp; 923 \\\\ 1 &amp; 682 \\\\ 2 &amp; 249 \\\\ 3 &amp; 70 \\\\ 4 &amp; 51 \\\\ 5 &amp; 25 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] In your model you assume that the number of claims for each policyholder has a Poisson distribution and that a policyholder’s expected number of claims is constant through time. Use Bühlmann credibility to estimate the annual expected number of claims for policyholders with 3 claims during the five-year period. Show Example Solution Solution Let \\(\\theta_i\\) be the risk parameter for the \\(i^{th}\\) risk in the portfolio with mean \\(\\mu(\\theta_i)\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)\\). With the Poisson assumption \\(\\mu(\\theta_i)=\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)\\). The expected value of the process variance is EPV=E(\\(\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)\\)) where the expectation is taken across all risks in the population. Because of the Poisson assumption for all risks it follows that EPV=E(\\(\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)\\))=E(\\(\\mu(\\theta_i)\\)). An estimate for the annual expected number of claims is \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta_i)\\)= (observed number of claims)/5. This can also serve as the estimate for the expected value of the process variance for a risk. Weighting the process variance estimates (or means) by the number of policies in each group gives the estimators \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{EPV}=\\bar{x}=\\frac{923(0)+682(1)+249(2)+70(3)+51(4)+25(5)}{(5)(2000)}=0.1719. \\end{equation*}\\] Using the formula ((9.12)), the VHM estimator is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\widehat{VHM}&amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{2000-1}[923(0-0.1719)^2+682(0.20-0.1719)^2+249(0.40-0.1719)^2\\\\ &amp; &amp;+70(0.60-0.1719)^2+51(0.80-0.1719)^2+25(1-0.1719)^2]-\\frac{0.1719}{5}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.0111\\\\ \\hat{K} &amp;=&amp; \\widehat{EPV}/\\widehat{VHM}=0.1719/0.0111=15.49\\\\ \\hat{Z} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{5}{5+15.49}=0.2440\\\\ \\hat{\\mu}_{3 \\textrm{ claims}}&amp; = &amp; 0.2440(3/5)+(1-0.2440)0.1719=0.2764 .\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 9.6.4 Balancing Credibility Estimators The credibility weighted model \\(\\hat{\\mu}(\\theta_i)=Z_i\\bar{X}_i+(1-Z_i)\\bar{X}\\), where \\(\\bar{X}_i\\) is the loss per exposure for risk \\(i\\) and \\(\\bar{X}\\) is loss per exposure for the population, can be used to estimate the expected loss for risk \\(i\\). The overall mean is \\(\\bar{X}=\\sum_{i=1}^r(m_i/m) \\bar{X}_i\\) where \\(m_i\\) and \\(m\\) are number of exposures for risk \\(i\\) and population, respectively. For the credibility weighted estimators to be in balance we want \\[\\begin{equation*} \\bar{X}=\\sum_{i=1}^r(m_i/m) \\bar{X}_i=\\sum_{i=1}^r(m_i/m) \\hat{\\mu}(\\theta_i). \\end{equation*}\\] If this equation is satisfied then the estimated losses for each risk will add up to the population total, an important goal in ratemaking, but this may not happen if \\(\\bar{X}\\) is used for the complement of credibility. In order to find a complement of credibility that will bring the credibility-weighted estimators into balance we will set \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) as the complement of credibility and analyze the following equation: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i=1}^r(m_i/m) \\bar{X}_i=\\sum_{i=1}^r(m_i/m) (Z_i\\bar{X}_i+(1-Z_i)\\hat{\\mu}) . \\end{equation*}\\] A little algebra gives \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i=1}^r m_i \\bar{X}_i=\\sum_{i=1}^r m_i Z_i\\bar{X}_i + \\hat{\\mu}\\sum_{i=1}^r m_i(1-Z_i), \\end{equation*}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^r m_i(1-Z_i)\\bar{X}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^r m_i(1-Z_i)}. \\end{equation*}\\] Using this value for \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) will bring the credibility weighted estimators into balance. If credibilities \\(Z_i\\) were computed using the Bühlmann-Straub model, then \\(Z_i=m_i/(m_i+K)\\). The prior formula can be simplified using the following relationship \\[\\begin{equation*} m_i(1-Z_i)=m_i\\left(1-\\frac{m_i}{m_i+K}\\right)=m_i\\left(\\frac{(m_i+K)-m_i}{m_i+K}\\right)=KZ_i . \\end{equation*}\\] Therefore, a complement of credibility that will bring the credibility-weighed estimators into balance with the overall mean loss per exposure is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^r Z_i \\bar{X}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^r Z_i}. \\end{equation*}\\] Example 9.6.6. An example from the nonparametric Bühlmann-Straub section had the following data for two risks. Find the complement of credibility \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) that will produce credibility-weighted estimates that are in balance. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Policyholder} &amp; &amp; \\text{Year 1} &amp; \\text{Year 2} &amp; \\text{Year 3} &amp; \\text{Year 4} \\\\ \\hline \\text{A} &amp; \\text{Number of claims} &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ \\hline \\text{A} &amp; \\text{Insured vehicles} &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ \\hline &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\text{B} &amp; \\text{Number of claims} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\\\ \\hline \\text{B} &amp; \\text{Insured vehicles} &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}\\] Show Example Solution Solution The credibilities from the prior example are \\(Z_A=\\frac{7}{7+2.0871}=0.7703\\) and \\(Z_B=\\frac{9}{9+2.0871}=0.8118\\). The sample means are \\(\\bar{x}_A=1\\) and \\(\\bar{x}_B=1/3\\). The balanced complement of credibility is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{0.7703(1)+0.8118(1/3)}{0.7703+0.8118}=0.6579. \\end{equation*}\\] The updated credibility estimates are \\(\\hat{\\mu}_A=0.7703(1)+(1-0.7703)(.6579)=0.9214\\) versus the previous 0.9139 and \\(\\hat{\\mu}_B=0.8118(1/3)+(1-0.8118)(.6579)=0.3944\\) versus the previous 0.3882. Checking the balance on the new estimators: (7/16)(0.9214)+(9/16)(0.3944)=0.6250. This exactly matches \\(\\bar{X}=10/16=0.6250\\).

An insurance portfolio is simply a collection of insurance contracts. To help manage the uncertainty of the portfolio, this chapter quantifies unusually large obligations by examining the tail of the distribution, quantifies the overall riskiness by introducing summaries known as risk measures, and discusses options of spreading portfolio risk through reinsurance, the purchase of insurance protection by an insurer. 10.1 Introduction to Insurance Portfolios Most of our analyses in prior chapters has been at the contract level which is an agreement between a policyholder and an insurer. Insurers hold, and manage, portfoliosA collection of contracts that are simply collections of contracts. As in other areas of finance, there are management decision-making choices that occur only at the portfolio level. For example, strategic decision-making does not occur at the contract level. It happens in the conference room, where management reviews available data and possibly steers a new course. From the portfolio perspective, insurers want to do capacity planning, set management policies, and balance the mix of products being booked to grow revenue while controlling volatility. Conceptually, one can think about an insurance company as nothing more than a collection, or portfolio, of insurance contracts. In Chapter 5 we learned about modeling insurance portfolios as the sum of individual contracts based on assumptions of independence among contracts. Because of their importance, this chapter focuses directly on portfolio distributions. Insurance portfoliosA collection, or aggregation, of insurance contracts represent obligations of insurers and so we are particularly interested in probabilities of large outcomes as these represent unusually large obligations. To formalize this concept, we introduce the notion of a heavy-tail distribution in Section 10.2. Insurance portfolios represent company obligations and so insurers keep an equivalent amount of assets to meet these obligations. Risk measures, introduced in Section 10.3, summarize the distribution of the insurance portfolio and these summary measures are used to quantify the amount of assets that an insurer needs to retain to meet obligations. In Section 3.4, we learned about mechanisms that policyholders use to spread risks such as deductibles and policy limits. In the same way, insurers use similar mechanisms in order to spread portfolio risks. They purchase risk protection from reinsurersA company that sells reinsurance, an insurance company for insurers. This sharing of insurance portfolio risk is described in Section 10.4. Show Quiz Solution 10.2 Tails of Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Describe a heavy tail distribution intuitively. Classify the heaviness of a distribution’s tails based on moments. Compare the tails of two distributions. In 1998 freezing rain fell on eastern Ontario, southwestern Quebec and lasted for six days. The event was double the amount of precipitation in the area experienced in any prior ice storm and resulted in a catastrophe that produced in excess of 840,000 insurance claims. This number is 20\\(\\%\\) more than that of claims caused by the Hurricane Andrew - one of the largest natural disasters in the history of North America. The catastrophe caused approximately 1.44 billion Canadian dollars in insurance settlements which is the highest loss burden in the history of Canada. This is not an isolated example - similar catastrophic events that caused extreme insurance losses are Hurricanes Harvey and Sandy, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and so forth. In the context of insurance, a few large losses hitting a portfolio and then converting into claims usually represent the greatest part of the indemnities paid by insurance companies. The aforementioned losses, also called ‘extremes’, are quantitatively modelled by the tails of the associated probability distributions. From the quantitative modelling standpoint, relying on probabilistic models with improper tails is rather daunting. For instance, periods of financial stress may appear with a higher frequency than expected, and insurance losses may occur with worse severity. Therefore, the study of probabilistic behavior in the tail portion of actuarial models is of utmost importance in the modern framework of quantitative risk management. For this reason, this section is devoted to the introduction of a few mathematical notions that characterize the tail weight of random variables (rv’s). The applications of these notions will benefit us in the construction and selection of appropriate models with desired mathematical properties in the tail portion, that are suitable for a given task. Formally, define \\(X\\) to be the (random) obligations that arise from a collection (portfolio) of insurance contracts. We are particularly interested in studying the right tail of the distribution of \\(X\\), which represents the occurrence of large losses. Informally, a rv is said to be heavy-tailed if high probabilities are assigned to large values. Note that this by no mean implies the probability density/mass functions are increasing as the value of rv goes to infinity. Ineed for a real-valued rv, the pdfProbability density function/pmfProbability mass function must diminish at infinity in order to guarantee the total probability to be equal to one. Instead, what we concern about is the rate of decaying of the probability function. Unwelcome outcomes are more likely to occur for an insurance portfolio that is described by a loss rv possessing heavier (right) tail. Tail weight can be an absolute or a relative concept. Specifically, for the former, we may consider a rv to be heavy-tailed if certain mathematical properties of the probability distribution are met. For the latter, we can say the tail of one distribution is heavier than the other if some tail measures are larger/smaller. Several quantitative approaches have been proposed to classify and compare tail weight. Among most of these approaches, the survival functionOne minus the distribution function. it gives the probability that a rv exceeds a specific value. serves as the building block. In what follows, we introduce two simple yet useful tail classification methods both of which are based on the behavior of the survival function of \\(X\\). 10.2.1 Classification Based on Moments One way of classifying the tail weight of distribution is by assessing the existence of raw moments. Since our major interest lies in the right tails of distributions, we henceforth assume the obligation or loss rv \\(X\\) to be positive. At the outset, the \\(k-\\)th raw moment of a continuous rv \\(X\\), introduced in Section 3.1, can be computed as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mu_k&#39; &amp;=&amp; k \\int_0^{\\infty} x^{k-1} S(x) dx, \\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(S(\\cdot)\\) denotes the survival function of \\(X\\). This expression emphasizes that the existence of the raw moments depends on the asymptotic behavior of the survival function at infinity. Namely, the faster the survival function decays to zero, the higher the order of finite moment (k) the associated rvRandom variable possesses.You may interpret \\(k^{\\ast}\\) to be the largest value of k so that the moment is finite. Formally, define \\(k^{\\ast}:=\\sup\\{k &gt; 0:\\mu_k&#39;&lt;\\infty \\}\\), where \\(sup\\) represents the supremum operator. This observation leads us to the moment-based tail weight classification method, which is defined formally next. Definition 10.1. Consider a positive loss random variable \\(X\\). If all the positive raw moments exist, namely the maximal order of finite moment \\(k^{\\ast}=\\infty\\), then \\(X\\) is said to be light tailed based on the moment method. If \\(k^{\\ast} &lt; \\infty\\), then \\(X\\) is said to be heavy tailedA rv is said to be heavy tailed if high probabilities are assigned to large values based on the moment method. Moreover, for two positive loss random variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) with maximal orders of moment \\(k^{\\ast}_1\\) and \\(k^{\\ast}_2\\) respectively, we say \\(X_1\\) has a heavier (right) tail than \\(X_2\\) if \\(k^{\\ast}_1\\leq k^{\\ast}_2\\). The first part of Definition 10.1 is an absolute concept of tail weight, while the second part is a relative concept of tail weight which compares the (right) tails between two distributions. Next, we present a few examples that illustrate the applications of the moment-based method for comparing tail weight. Example 10.2.1. Light tail nature of the gamma distribution. Let \\(X\\sim gamma(\\alpha,\\theta)\\), with \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\) and \\(\\theta&gt;0\\), then for all \\(k&gt;0\\), show that \\(\\mu_k&#39; &lt; \\infty\\). Show Example Solution Solution. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mu_k&#39; &amp;=&amp; \\int_0^{\\infty} x^k \\frac{x^{\\alpha-1} e^{-x/\\theta}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha) \\theta^{\\alpha}} dx \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\int_0^{\\infty} (y\\theta)^k \\frac{(y\\theta)^{\\alpha-1} e^{-y}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha) \\theta^{\\alpha}} \\theta dy \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\theta^k}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\Gamma(\\alpha+k) &lt; \\infty. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Since all the positive moments exist, i.e., \\(k^{\\ast}=\\infty\\), in accordance with the moment-based classification method in Definition 10.1, the gamma distribution is light-tailed. Example 10.2.2. Light tail nature of the Weibull distribution. Let \\(X\\sim Weibull(\\theta,\\tau)\\), with \\(\\theta&gt;0\\) and \\(\\tau&gt;0\\), then for all \\(k&gt;0\\), show that \\(\\mu_k&#39; &lt; \\infty\\). Show Example Solution Solution. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mu_k&#39; &amp;=&amp; \\int_0^{\\infty} x^k \\frac{\\tau x^{\\tau-1} }{\\theta^{\\tau}} e^{-(x/\\theta)^{\\tau}}dx \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{ y^{k/\\tau} }{\\theta^{\\tau}} e^{-y/\\theta^{\\tau}}dy \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\theta^{k} \\Gamma(1+k/\\tau) &lt; \\infty. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Again, due to the existence of all the positive moments, the Weibull distribution is light-tailed. The gamma and Weibull distributions are used quite extensively in the actuarial practice. Applications of these two distributions are vast which include, but are not limited to, insurance claim severity modelling, solvency assessment, loss reserving, aggregate risk approximation, reliability engineering and failure analysis. We have thus far seen two examples of using the moment-based method to analyze light-tailed distributions. We document a heavy-tailed example in what follows. Example 10.2.3. Heavy tail nature of the Pareto distribution. Let \\(X\\sim Pareto(\\alpha,\\theta)\\), with \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\) and \\(\\theta&gt;0\\), then for \\(k&gt;0\\) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mu_k^{&#39;} &amp;=&amp; \\int_0^{\\infty} x^k \\frac{\\alpha \\theta^{\\alpha}}{(x+\\theta)^{\\alpha+1}} dx \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\alpha \\theta^{\\alpha} \\int_{\\theta}^{\\infty} (y-\\theta)^k {y^{-(\\alpha+1)}} dy. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Consider a similar integration: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} g_k:=\\int_{\\theta}^{\\infty} {y^{k-\\alpha-1}} dy=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} &lt;\\infty, &amp; \\hbox{for } k&lt;\\alpha;\\\\ =\\infty, &amp; \\hbox{for } k\\geq \\alpha. \\end{array} \\right. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Meanwhile, \\[\\lim_{y\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{(y-\\theta)^k {y^{-(\\alpha+1)}}}{y^{k-\\alpha-1}}=\\lim_{y\\rightarrow \\infty} (1-\\theta/y)^{k}=1.\\] Application of the limit comparison theorem for improper integrals yields \\(\\mu_k&#39;\\) is finite if and only if \\(g_k\\) is finite. Hence we can conclude that the raw moments of Pareto rv’s exist only up to \\(k&lt;\\alpha\\), i.e., \\(k^{\\ast}=\\alpha\\), and thus the distribution is heavy-tailed. What is more, the maximal order of finite moment depends only on the shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and it is an increasing function of \\(\\alpha\\). In other words, based on the moment method, the tail weight of Pareto rv’s is solely manipulated by \\(\\alpha\\) – the smaller the value of \\(\\alpha\\), the heavier the tail weight becomes. Since \\(k^{\\ast}&lt;\\infty\\), the tail of Pareto distribution is heavier than those of the gamma and Weibull distributions. We conclude this section with an open discussion on the limitations of the moment-based method. Despite its simple implementation and intuitive interpretation, there are certain circumstances in which the application of the moment-based method is not suitable. First, for more complicated probabilistic models, the \\(k\\)-th raw moment may not be simple to derive, and thus the identification of the maximal order of finite moment can be challenging. Second, the moment-based method does not well comply with main body of the well established heavy tail theory in the literature. Specifically, the existence of moment generating functions is arguably the most popular method for classifying heavy tail versus light tail within the community of academic actuaries. However, for some rv’s such as the lognormal rv’s, their moment generating functions do not exist even that all the positive moments are finite. In these cases, applications of the moment-based methods can lead to different tail weight assessment. Third, when we need to compare the tail weight between two light-tailed distributions both having all positive moments exist, the moment-based method is no longer informative (see, e.g., Examples 10.2.1 and 10.2.2). 10.2.2 Comparison Based on Limiting Tail Behavior In order to resolve the aforementioned issues of the moment-based classification method, an alternative approach for comparing tail weight is to directly study the limiting behavior of the survival functions. Definition 10.2. For two rv’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), let \\[ \\gamma:=\\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{S_X(t)}{S_Y(t)}. \\] We say that \\(X\\) has a heavier right tail than \\(Y\\) if \\(\\gamma=\\infty\\); \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are proportionally equivalent in the right tail if \\(\\gamma =c\\in \\mathbf{R}_+\\); \\(X\\) has a lighter right tail than \\(Y\\) if \\(\\gamma=0\\). Example 10.2.4. Comparison of Pareto to Weibull distributions. Let \\(X\\sim Pareto(\\alpha, \\theta)\\) and \\(Y\\sim Weibull(\\tau, \\theta)\\), for \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\), \\(\\tau&gt;0\\), and \\(\\theta&gt;0\\). Show that the Pareto has a heavier right tail than the Weibull. Show Example Solution Solution. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{S_X(t)}{S_Y(t)} &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{(1+t/\\theta)^{-\\alpha}}{\\exp\\{-(t/\\theta)^{\\tau}\\}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\exp\\{t/\\theta^{\\tau} \\}}{(1+t^{1/\\tau}/\\theta)^{\\alpha}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\theta^{\\tau}}\\right)^{i}/i!}{(1+t^{1/\\tau}/\\theta)^{\\alpha}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\left(t^{-i/\\alpha}+\\frac{t^{(1/\\tau-i/\\alpha)}}{\\theta} \\right)^{-\\alpha}/\\theta^{\\tau i}i!\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\infty. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Therefore, the Pareto distribution has a heavier tail than the Weibull distribution. One may also realize that exponentials go to infinity faster than polynomials, thus the aforementioned limit must be infinite. For some distributions of which the survival functions do not admit explicit expressions, we may find the following alternative formula useful: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\lim_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{S_X(t)}{S_Y(t)} &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{S_X^{&#39;}(t)}{S_Y^{&#39;}(t)} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{-f_X(t)}{-f_Y(t)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{f_X(t)}{f_Y(t)}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] given that the density functions exist. Example 10.2.5. Comparison of Pareto to gamma distributions. Let \\(X\\sim Pareto(\\alpha, \\theta)\\) and \\(Y\\sim gamma(\\alpha, \\theta)\\), for \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\) and \\(\\theta&gt;0\\). Show that the Pareto has a heavier right tail than the gamma. Show Example Solution Solution. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\lim_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{f_{X}(t)}{f_{Y}(t)} &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\alpha \\theta^{\\alpha} (t+ \\theta)^{-\\alpha-1}}{t^{\\tau-1} e^{-t/\\lambda} \\lambda^{-\\tau} \\Gamma(\\tau)^{-1}} \\\\ &amp;\\propto&amp; \\lim_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{e^{t/\\lambda}}{(t+\\theta)^{\\alpha+1} t^{\\tau-1}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\infty, \\end{eqnarray*}\\] as exponentials go to infinity faster than polynomials. Show Quiz Solution 10.3 Risk Measures In this section, you learn how to: Define the idea of coherence and determine whether or not a risk measure is coherent. Define the value-at-risk and calculate this quantity for a given distribution. Define the tail value-at-risk and calculate this quantity for a given distribution. In the previous section, we studied two methods for classifying the weight of distribution tails. We may claim that the risk associated with one distribution is more dangerous (asymptotically) than the others if the tail is heavier. However, knowing one risk is more dangerous (asymptotically) than the others may not provide sufficient information for a sophisticated risk management purpose, and in addition, one is also interested in quantifying how much more. In fact, the magnitude of risk associated with a given loss distribution is an essential input for many insurance applications, such as actuarial pricing, reserving, hedging, insurance regulatory oversight, and so forth. 10.3.1 Coherent Risk Measures To compare the magnitude of risk in a practically convenient manner, we seek a function that maps the loss rv of interest to a numerical value indicating the level of riskiness, which is termed the risk measureA measure that summarizes the riskiness, or uncertainty, of a distribution. Put mathematically, the risk measure simply summarizes the distribution function of a rv as a single number. Two simple risk measures are the mean \\(\\mathrm{E}[X]\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\mathrm{SD}(X)=\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}\\). Other classical examples of risk measures include the standard deviation principle \\[\\begin{equation} H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X):=\\mathrm{E}[X]+\\alpha \\mathrm{SD}(X),\\text{ for } \\alpha\\geq 0, \\tag{10.1} \\end{equation}\\] and the variance principle \\[ H_{\\mathrm{Var}}(X):=\\mathrm{E}[X]+\\alpha \\mathrm{Var}(X),\\text{ for } \\alpha\\geq 0. \\] It is a simple matter to check that all the aforementioned functions are risk measures in which we input the loss rv and the functions output a numerical value. On a different note, the function \\(H^{\\ast}(X):=\\alpha X^{\\beta}\\) for any real-valued \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\neq 0\\), is not a risk measure because \\(H^{\\ast}\\) produces another rv rather than a single numerical value. Since risk measures are scalar measures which aim to use a single numerical value to describe the stochastic nature of loss rv’s, it should not be surprising to us that there is no risk measure which can capture all the risk information of the associated rv’s. Therefore, when seeking useful risk measures, it is important for us to keep in mind that the measures should be at least interpretable practically; computable conveniently; and able to reflect the most critical information of risk underpinning the loss distribution. Several risk measures have been developed in the literature. Unfortunately, there is no best risk measure that can outperform the others, and the selection of appropriate risk measure depends mainly on the application questions at hand. In this respect, it is imperative to emphasize that risk is a subjective concept, and thus even given the same problem, there are multifarious approaches to assess risk. However, for many risk management applications, there is a wide agreement that economically sounded risk measures should satisfy four major axioms which we are going to describe in detail next. Risk measures that satisfy these axioms are termed coherent risk measures. Consider in what follows a risk measure \\(H(\\cdot)\\), then \\(H\\) is a coherent risk measureA risk measure that is is subadditive, monontonic, has positive homogeneity, and is translation invariant. if the following axioms are satisfied. Axiom 1. Subadditivity: \\(H(X+Y)\\leq H(X)+H(Y)\\). The economic implication of this axiom is that diversification benefits exist if different risks are combined. Axiom 2. Monotonicity: if \\(\\Pr[X\\leq Y]=1\\), then \\(H(X)\\leq H(Y)\\). Recall that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are rv’s representing losses, the underlying economic implication is that higher losses essentially leads to a higher level of risk. Axiom 3. Positive homogeneity: \\(H(cX)=cH(X)\\) for any positive constant \\(c\\). A potential economic implication about this axiom is that risk measure should be independent of the monetary units in which the risk is measured. For example, let \\(c\\) be the currency exchange rate between the US and Canadian dollars, then the risk of random losses measured in terms of US dollars (i.e., X) and Canadian dollars (i.e., cX) should be different only up to the exchange rate \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(cH(x)=H(cX)\\)). Axiom 4. Translation invariance: \\(H(X+c)=H(X)+c\\) for any positive constant \\(c\\). If the constant \\(c\\) is interpreted as risk-free cash, this axiom tells that no additional risk is created for adding cash to an insurance portfolio, and injecting risk-free capital of \\(c\\) can only reduce the risk by the same amount. Verifying the coherent properties for some risk measures can be quite straightforward, but it can be very challenging sometimes. For example, it is a simple matter to check that the mean is a coherent risk measure. Example. The Mean is a Coherent Risk Measure. For any pair of rv’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) having finite means and constant \\(c&gt;0\\), validation of subadditivity: \\(\\mathrm{E}[X+Y]=\\mathrm{E}[X]+\\mathrm{E}[Y]\\); validation of monotonicity: if \\(\\Pr[X\\leq Y]=1\\), then \\(\\mathrm{E}[X]\\leq \\mathrm{E}[Y]\\); validation of positive homogeneity: \\(\\mathrm{E}[cX]=c\\mathrm{E}[X]\\); validation of translation invariance: \\(\\mathrm{E}[X+c]=\\mathrm{E}[X]+c\\) With a little more effort, we can determine the following. Example. The Standard Deviation is not a Coherent Risk Measure. Show Example Verification On a different note, the standard deviation is not a coherent risk measure. Specifically, one can check that the standard deviation satisfies validation of subadditivity: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{SD}[X+Y]&amp;=&amp;\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)+\\mathrm{Var}(Y)+2\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}\\\\ &amp;\\leq&amp; \\sqrt{\\mathrm{SD}(X)^2+\\mathrm{SD}(Y)^2+2\\mathrm{SD}(X)\\mathrm{SD}(Y)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{SD}(X)+\\mathrm{SD}(Y); \\end{eqnarray*}\\] validation of positive homogeneity: \\(\\mathrm{SD}[cX]=c~\\mathrm{SD}[X]\\). However, the standard deviation does not comply with translation invariance property as for any positive constant \\(c\\), \\[ \\mathrm{SD}(X+c)=\\mathrm{SD}(X)&lt;\\mathrm{SD}(X)+c. \\] Moreover, the standard deviation also does not satisfy the monotonicity property. To see this, consider the following two rv’s: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} X=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0, &amp; \\hbox{with probability $0.25$;} \\\\ 4, &amp; \\hbox{with probability $0.75$,} \\end{array} \\right. \\tag{10.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] and \\(Y\\) is a degenerate rv such that \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\Pr[Y = 4] = 1. \\tag{10.3} \\end{eqnarray}\\] It is easy to check that \\(\\Pr[X\\leq Y]=1\\), but \\(\\mathrm{SD}(X)=\\sqrt{4^2\\cdot 0.25\\cdot 0.75}=\\sqrt{3}&gt;\\mathrm{SD}(Y)=0\\). We have so far checked that \\(\\mathrm{E}[\\cdot]\\) is a coherent risk measure, but not \\(\\mathrm{SD}(\\cdot)\\). Let us now proceed to study the coherent property for the standard deviation principle (10.1) which is a linear combination of coherent and incoherent risk measures. Example. The Standard Deviation Principle (10.1) is a Coherent Risk Measure. Show Example Verification To this end, for a given \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\), we check the four axioms for \\(H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X+Y)\\) one by one: validation of subadditivity: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X+Y) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{E}[X+Y]+\\alpha \\mathrm{SD}(X+Y) \\\\ &amp;\\leq&amp; \\mathrm{E}[X]+\\mathrm{E}[Y]+\\alpha [\\mathrm{SD}(X) +\\mathrm{SD}(Y)]\\\\ &amp;=&amp; H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X)+ H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(Y); \\end{eqnarray*}\\] validation of positive homogeneity: \\[ H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(cX)=c\\mathrm{E}[X]+c\\alpha\\mathrm{SD}(X)=cH_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X); \\] validation of translation invariance: \\[ H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X+c)=\\mathrm{E}[X]+c+\\alpha\\mathrm{SD}(X)=H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X)+c. \\] It only remains to verify the monotonicity property, which may or may not be satisfied depending on the value of \\(\\alpha\\). To see this, consider again the setup of (10.2) and (10.3) in which \\(\\Pr[X\\leq Y]=1\\). Let \\(\\alpha=0.1\\cdot \\sqrt{3}\\), then \\(H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X)=3+0.3=3.3&lt; H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(Y)=4\\) and the monotonicity condition is met. On the other hand, let \\(\\alpha=\\sqrt{3}\\), then \\(H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X)=3+3=6&gt; H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(Y)=4\\) and the monotonicity condition is not satisfied. More precisely, by setting \\[ H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(X) = 3+\\alpha\\sqrt{3} \\leq4= H_{\\mathrm{SD}}(Y), \\] we find that the monotonicity condition is only satisfied for \\(0\\leq\\alpha\\leq 1/\\sqrt{3}\\), and thus the standard deviation principle \\(H_{\\mathrm{SD}}\\) is coherent. This result appears to be very intuitive to us since the standard deviation principle \\(H_{\\mathrm{SD}}\\) is a linear combination of two risk measures of which one is coherent and the other is incoherent. If \\(\\alpha\\leq 1/\\sqrt{3}\\), then the coherent measure dominates the incoherent one, thus the resulting measure \\(H_{\\mathrm{SD}}\\) is coherent and vice versa. Note that the aforementioned conclusion may not be generalized to any pair of rv’s \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The literature on risk measures has been growing rapidly in popularity and importance. In the succeeding two subsections, we introduce two indices which have recently earned an unprecedented amount of interest among theoreticians, practitioners, and regulators. They are namely the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and the Tail Value-at-Risk (TVaR) measures. The economic rationale behind these two popular risk measures is similar to that for the tail classification methods introduced in the previous section, with which we hope to capture the risk of extremal losses represented by the distribution tails. 10.3.2 Value-at-Risk In Section 4.1.1.3, we defined the quantile of a distribution. We now look to a special case of this and offer the formal definition of the value-at-riskA risk measure based on a quantile function, or VaR. Definition 10.3. Consider an insurance loss random variable \\(X\\). The value-at-risk measure of \\(X\\) with confidence level \\(q\\in (0,1)\\) is formulated as \\[\\begin{eqnarray} VaR_q[X]:=\\inf\\{x:F_X(x)\\geq q\\}. \\tag{10.4} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Here, \\(inf\\) is the infimum operator so that the VaR measure outputs the smallest value of \\(X\\) such that the associated cdfCumulative distribution function first exceeds or equates to \\(q\\). Here is how we should interpret VaR in the context of actuarial applications. The VaR is a measure of the ‘maximal’ probable loss for an insurance product/portfolio or a risky investment occurring \\(q\\times 100\\%\\) of times, over a specific time horizon (typically, one year). For instance, let \\(X\\) be the annual loss rv of an insurance product, \\(VaR_{0.95}[X]=100\\) million means that there is a \\(5\\%\\) chance that the loss will exceed 100 million over a given year. Owing to this meaningful interpretation, VaR has become the industrial standard to measuring financial and insurance risks since 1990’s. Financial conglomerates, regulators, and academics often utilize VaR to measure risk capital, ensure the compliance with regulatory rules, and disclose the financial positions. Next, we present a few examples about the computation of VaR. Example 10.3.1. VaR for the exponential distribution. Consider an insurance loss rv \\(X\\sim Exp(\\theta)\\) for \\(\\theta&gt;0\\), then the cdf of \\(X\\) is given by \\[ F_X(x)=1-e^{-x/\\theta}, \\text{ for } x&gt;0. \\] Give a closed-form expression for the VaR. Show Example Solution Solution. Because exponential distribution is a continuous distribution, the smallest value such that the cdf first exceeds or equates to \\(q \\in (0,1)\\) must be at the point \\(x_q\\) satisfying \\[ q=F_X(x_q)=1-\\exp\\{-x_q/\\theta \\}. \\] Thus \\[ VaR_q[X]=F_X^{-1}(q)=-\\theta[\\log(1-q)]. \\] The result reported in Example 10.3.1 can be generalized to any continuous rv’s having strictly increasing cdf. Specifically, the VaR of any continuous rv’s is simply the inverse of the corresponding cdf. Let us consider another example of continuous rv which has the support from negative infinity to positive infinity. Example 10.3.2. VaR for the normal distribution. Consider an insurance loss rv \\(X\\sim Normal(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) with \\(\\sigma&gt;0\\). In this case, one may interpret the negative values of \\(X\\) as profit or revenue. Give a closed-form expression for the VaR. Show Example Solution Solution. Because normal distribution is a continuous distribution, the VaR of \\(X\\) must satisfy \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} q &amp;=&amp; F_X(VaR_q[X])\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\Pr\\left[(X-\\mu)/\\sigma\\leq (VaR_q[X]-\\mu)/\\sigma\\right]\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\Phi((VaR_q[X]-\\mu)/\\sigma). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Therefore, we have \\[ VaR_q[X]=\\Phi^{-1}(q)\\ \\sigma+\\mu. \\] In many insurance applications, we have to deal with transformations of rv’s. For instance, in Example 10.3.2, the loss rv \\(X\\sim Normal(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) can be viewed as a linear transformation of a standard normal rv \\(Z\\sim Normal(0,1)\\), namely \\(X=Z\\sigma+\\mu\\). By setting \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(\\sigma=1\\), it is straightforward for us to check \\(VaR_q[Z]=\\Phi^{-1}(q).\\) A useful finding revealed from Example 10.3.2 is that the VaR of a linear transformation of the normal rv’s is equivalent to the linear transformation of the VaR of the original rv’s. This finding can be further generalized to any rv’s as long as the transformations are strictly increasing. Example 10.3.3. VaR for transformed variables. Consider an insurance loss rv \\(Y\\sim lognormal(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), for \\(\\mu\\in \\mathbf{R}\\) and \\(\\sigma&gt;0\\). Give an expression of the \\(VaR\\) of \\(Y\\) in terms of the standard normal inverse cdf. Show Example Solution Solution. Note that \\(\\log Y\\sim Normal(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), or equivalently let \\(X\\sim Normal(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), then \\(Y\\overset{d}{=}e^{X}\\) which is strictly increasing transformation. Here, the notation `\\(\\overset{d}{=}\\)’ means equality in distribution. The VaR of \\(Y\\) is thus given by the exponential transformation of the VaR of \\(X\\). Precisely, for \\(q\\in (0,1)\\), \\[ VaR_{q}[Y]= e^{VaR_q[X]}=\\exp\\{\\Phi^{-1}(q)\\ \\sigma+\\mu\\}. \\] We have thus far seen a number of examples about the VaR for continuous rv’s, let us consider an example concerning the VaR for a discrete rv. Example 10.3.4. VaR for a discrete random variable. Consider an insurance loss rv with the following probability distribution: \\[ {\\small \\Pr[X=x]=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1, &amp; \\hbox{with probability $0.75$} \\\\ 3, &amp; \\hbox{with probability $0.20$} \\\\ 4, &amp; \\hbox{with probability $0.05$.} \\end{array} \\right. } \\] Determine the VaR at \\(q = 0.6, 0.9, 0.95, 0.95001\\). Show Example Solution Solution. The corresponding cdf of \\(X\\) is \\[ F_X(x)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0, &amp; \\hbox{ $x&lt;1$;} \\\\ 0.75, &amp; \\hbox{ $1\\leq x&lt;3$;} \\\\ 0.95, &amp; \\hbox{ $3\\leq x&lt;4$;} \\\\ 1, &amp; \\hbox{ $4\\leq x$.} \\end{array} \\right. \\] By the definition of VaR, we thus have then \\(VaR_{0.6}[X]=1\\); \\(VaR_{0.9}[X]=3\\); \\(VaR_{0.95}[X]=3\\); \\(VaR_{0.950001}[X]=4\\). Let us now conclude the current subsection by an open discussion of the VaR measure. Some advantages of utilizing VaR include possessing a practically meaningful interpretation; relatively simple to compute for many distributions with closed-form distribution functions; no additional assumption is required for the computation of VaR. On the other hand, the limitations of VaR can be particularly pronounced for some risk management practices. We report some of them herein: the selection of the confidence level \\(q\\in (0,1)\\) is highly subjective, while the VaR can be very sensitive to the choice of \\(q\\) (e.g., in Example 10.3.4, \\(VaR_{0.95}[X]=3\\) and \\(VaR_{0.950001}[X]=4\\)); the scenarios/loss information that are above the \\((1-p)\\times 100\\%\\) worst event, are completely neglected; VaR is not a coherent risk measure (specifically, the VaR measure does not satisfy the subadditivity axiom, meaning that diversification benefits may not be fully reflected). 10.3.3 Tail Value-at-Risk Recall that the VaR represents the \\((1-p)\\times100\\%\\) chance maximal loss. As we mentioned in the previous section, one major drawback of the VaR measure is that it does not reflect the extremal losses occurring beyond the \\((1-p)\\times100\\%\\) chance worst scenario. For illustrative purposes, let us consider the following slightly unrealistic yet inspiring example. Example 10.3.5. Consider two loss rv’s \\(X\\sim Uniform [0,100]\\), and \\(Y\\sim Exp(31.71)\\). We use VaR at \\(95\\%\\) confidence level to measure the riskiness of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Simple calculation yields (see, also, Example 10.3.1), \\[ VaR_{0.95}[X]=VaR_{0.95}[Y]=95, \\] and thus these two loss distributions have the same level of risk according to \\(VaR_{0.95}\\). However, it is clear that \\(Y\\) is riskier than \\(X\\) if extremal losses are of major concern since \\(X\\) is bounded above while \\(Y\\) is unbounded. Simply quantifying risk by using VaR at a specific confidence level could be misleading and may not reflect the true nature of risk. As a remedy, the Tail Value-at-Risk (TVaR) was proposed to measure the extremal losses that are above a given level of VaR as an average. We document the definition of TVaR in what follows. For the sake of simplicity, we are going to confine ourselves to continuous positive rv’s only, which are more frequently used in the context of insurance risk management. We refer the interested reader to Hardy (2006) for a more comprehensive discussion of TVaR for both discrete and continuous rv’s. Definition 10.4. Fix \\(q\\in (0,1)\\), the tail value-at-riskThe expected value of a risk given that the risk exceeds a value-at-risk of a (continuous) rv \\(X\\) is formulated as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} TVaR_q[X] &amp;:=&amp; \\mathrm{E}[X|X&gt;VaR_q[X]], \\end{eqnarray*}\\] given that the expectation exists. In light of Definition 10.4, the computation of TVaR typically consists of two major components - the VaR and the average of losses that are above the VaR. The TVaR can be computed via a number of formulas. Consider a continuous positive rv \\(X\\), for notional convenience, henceforth let us write \\(\\pi_q:=VaR_q[X]\\). By definition, the TVaR can be computed via \\[\\begin{eqnarray} TVaR_{q}[X]=\\frac{1}{(1-q)}\\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty}xf_X(x)dx. \\tag{10.5} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Example 10.3.6. TVaR for a normal distribution. Consider an insurance loss rv \\(X\\sim Normal (\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) with \\(\\mu\\in \\mathbf{R}\\) and \\(\\sigma&gt;0\\). Give an expression for TVaR. Show Example Solution Solution. Let \\(Z\\) be the standard normal rv. For \\(q\\in(0,1)\\), the TVaR of \\(X\\) can be computed via \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} TVaR_q[X] &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{E}[X|X&gt;VaR_q[X]]\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{E}[\\sigma Z+\\mu|\\sigma Z+\\mu&gt;VaR_q[X]]\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sigma\\mathrm{E}[Z|Z&gt;(VaR_q[X]-\\mu)/\\sigma]+\\mu\\\\ &amp;\\overset{(1)}{=}&amp; \\sigma\\mathrm{E}[Z|Z&gt;VaR_q[Z]]+\\mu, \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where `\\(\\overset{(1)}{=}\\)’ holds because of the results reported in Example 10.3.2. Next, we turn to study \\(TVaR_q[Z]=\\mathrm{E}[Z|Z&gt;VaR_q[Z]]\\). Let \\(\\omega(q)=(\\Phi^{-1}(q))^2/2\\), we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (1-q)\\ TVaR_q[Z] &amp;=&amp; \\int_{\\Phi^{-1}(q)}^{\\infty} z \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}dz\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\int_{\\omega(q)}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-x}dx\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\omega(q)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\phi(\\Phi^{-1}(q)). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Thus, \\[ TVaR_q[X]=\\sigma\\frac{\\phi(\\Phi^{-1}(q))}{1-q}+\\mu. \\] We mentioned earlier in the previous subsection that the VaR of a strictly increasing function of rv is equal to the function of VaR of the original rv. Motivated by the results in Example 10.3.6, one can show that the TVaR of a strictly increasing linear transformation of rv is equal to the function of VaR of the original rv This is due to the linearity property of expectations. However, the aforementioned finding cannot be extended to non-linear functions. The following example of lognormal rv serves as a counter example. Example 10.3.7. TVaR of a lognormal distribution. Consider an insurance loss rv \\(X\\sim lognormal (\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), with \\(\\sigma&gt;0\\). Show that \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} TVaR_q[X] &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{\\mu+\\sigma^2/2}}{(1-q)} \\Phi(\\Phi^{-1}(q)-\\sigma). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Show Example Solution Solution. Recall that the pdf of lognormal distribution is formulated as \\[ f_X(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi} x}\\exp\\{-(\\ln x-\\mu )^2/2\\sigma^2 \\}, \\text{ for } x&gt;0. \\] Fix \\(q\\in(0,1)\\), then the TVaR of \\(X\\) can be computed via \\[\\begin{eqnarray} TVaR_q[X] &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{(1-q)} \\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty} x f_X(x)dx \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{(1-q)} \\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left\\{ -\\frac{(\\log x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right\\}dx\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;\\overset{(1)}{=}&amp;\\frac{1}{(1-q)} \\int_{\\omega(q)}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{ -\\frac{1}{2}w^2+\\sigma w+\\mu}dw\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{e^{\\mu+\\sigma^2/2}}{(1-q)} \\int_{\\omega(q)}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{ -\\frac{1}{2}(w-\\sigma)^2}dw\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{e^{\\mu+\\sigma^2/2}}{(1-q)} \\Phi(\\omega(q)-\\sigma), \\tag{10.6} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(\\overset{(1)}{=}\\) holds by applying change of variable \\(w=(\\log x-\\mu)/\\sigma\\), and \\(\\omega(q)=(\\log \\pi_q-\\mu)/\\sigma\\). Evoking the formula of VaR for lognormal rv reported in Example 10.3.2, we can simplify the expression (10.6) into \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} TVaR_q[X] &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{\\mu+\\sigma^2/2}}{(1-q)} \\Phi(\\Phi^{-1}(q)-\\sigma). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Clearly, the TVaR of lognormal rv is not the exponential of the TVaR of normal rv. For distributions of which the distribution functions are more tractable to work with, we may apply the integration by parts technique to rewrite equation (10.5) as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} TVaR_{q}[X]&amp;=&amp;\\left[-x S_X(x)\\big |_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty}+\\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty}S_X(x)dx\\right]\\frac{1}{(1-q)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q +\\frac{1}{(1-q)}\\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty}S_X(x)dx. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Example 10.3.8. TVaR of an exponential distribution. Consider an insurance loss rv \\(X\\sim Exp(\\theta)\\) for \\(\\theta&gt;0\\). Give an expression for the TVaR. Show Example Solution Solution. We have seen from the previous subsection that \\[ \\pi_q=-\\theta[\\log(1-q)]. \\] Let us now consider the TVaR: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} TVaR_q[X] &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q+\\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty} e^{-x/\\theta}dx/(1-q)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q+\\theta e^{-\\pi_q/\\theta}/(1-q)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q+\\theta. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] It can also be helpful to express the TVaR in terms of limited expected values. Specifically, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray} TVaR_q[X] &amp;=&amp; \\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty} (x-\\pi_q+\\pi_q)f_X(x)dx/(1-q) \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q+\\frac{1}{(1-q)}\\int_{\\pi_q}^{\\infty} (x-\\pi_q)f_X(x)dx\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q+e_X(\\pi_q)\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q +\\frac{\\left({\\mathrm{E}[X]-\\mathrm{E}[X\\wedge\\pi_q]}\\right)}{(1-q)}, \\tag{10.7} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(e_X(d):=\\mathrm{E}[X-d|X&gt;d]\\) for \\(d&gt;0\\) denotes the mean excess loss functionThe expected value of a loss in excess of a quantity, given that the loss exceeds the quantity. For many commonly used parametric distributions, the formulas for calculating \\(\\mathrm{E}[X]\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}[X\\wedge\\pi_q]\\) can be found in a table of distributions. Example 10.3.9. TVaR of the Pareto distribution. Consider a loss rv \\(X\\sim Pareto(\\theta,\\alpha)\\) with \\(\\theta&gt;0\\) and \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\). The cdf of \\(X\\) is given by \\[ F_X(x)=1-\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+x} \\right)^{\\alpha}, \\text{ for } x&gt;0 . \\] Fix \\(q\\in (0,1)\\) and set \\(F_X(\\pi_q)=q\\), we readily obtain \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\pi_q=\\theta\\left[(1-q)^{-1/\\alpha}-1 \\right]. \\tag{10.8} \\end{eqnarray}\\] According to the distribution table provided in the Society of Actuaries, we know \\[ \\mathrm{E}[X]=\\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha-1}, \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{E}[X\\wedge \\pi_q]=\\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha-1}\\left[ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+\\pi_q}\\right)^{\\alpha-1} \\right]. \\] Evoking equation (10.7) yields \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} TVaR_q[X] &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q+\\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha-1} \\frac{(\\theta/(\\theta+\\pi_q))^{\\alpha-1}} {(\\theta/(\\theta+\\pi_q))^{\\alpha}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\pi_q +\\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha-1}\\left( \\frac{\\pi_q+\\theta}{\\theta} \\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\pi_q+\\frac{\\pi_q+\\theta}{\\alpha-1}, \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\pi_q\\) is given by (10.8). Via a change of variables, we can also rewrite equation (10.5) as \\[\\begin{eqnarray} TVaR_{q}[X] &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{(1-q)}\\int_{q}^{1} VaR_{\\alpha}[X]\\ d\\alpha. \\tag{10.9} \\end{eqnarray}\\] What this alternative formula (10.9) tells is that TVaR in fact is the average of \\(VaR_{\\alpha}[X]\\) with varying degree of confidence level over \\(\\alpha\\in [q,1]\\). Therefore, the TVaR effectively resolves most of the limitations of VaR outlined in the previous subsection. First, due to the averaging effect, the TVaR may be less sensitive to the change of confidence level compared with VaR. Second, all the extremal losses that are above the \\((1-q)\\times 100\\%\\) worst probable event are taken in account. In this respect, it is a simple matter for us to see that for any given \\(q\\in (0,1)\\) \\[ TVaR_q[X]\\geq VaR_q[X]. \\] Third and perhaps foremost, TVaR is a coherent risk measure and thus is able to more accurately capture the diversification effects of insurance portfolio. Herein, we do not intend to provide the proof of the coherent feature for TVaR, which is considered to be challenging technically. Show Quiz Solution 10.4 Reinsurance In this section, you learn how to: Define basic reinsurance treaties including proportional, quota share, non-proportional, stop-loss, excess of loss, and surplus share. Interpret the optimality of quota share for reinsurers and compute optimal quota share agreements. Interpret the optimality of stop-loss for insurers. Interpret and calculate optimal excess of loss retention limits. Recall that reinsuranceInsurance purchased by an insurer is simply insurance purchased by an insurer. Insurance purchased by non-insurers is sometimes known as primary insuranceInsurance purchased by a non-insurer to distinguish it from reinsurance. Reinsurance differs from personal insurance purchased by individuals, such as auto and homeowners insurance, in contract flexibility. Like insurance purchased by major corporations, reinsurance programs are generally tailored more closely to the buyer. For contrast, in personal insurance buyers typically cannot negotiate on the contract terms although they may have a variety of different options (contracts) from which to choose. The two broad types are proportional and non-proportional reinsurance. A proportional reinsuranceAn agreement between a reinsurer and a ceding company (also known as the reinsured) in which the reinsurer assumes a given percent of losses and premium contract is an agreement between a reinsurer and a ceding companyA company that purchases reinsurance (also known as the reinsured) (also known as the reinsuredA company that purchases reinsurance (also known as the ceding company)) in which the reinsurer assumes a given percent of losses and premium. A reinsurance contract is also known as a treatyA reinsurance contract that applies to a designated book of business or exposures.. Non-proportional agreements are simply everything else. As examples of non-proportional agreements, this chapter focuses on stop-loss and excess of loss contracts. For all types of agreements, we split the total risk \\(X\\) into the portion taken on by the reinsurer, \\(Y_{reinsurer}\\), and that retained by the insurer, \\(Y_{insurer}\\), that is, \\(X= Y_{insurer}+Y_{reinsurer}\\). The mathematical structure of a basic reinsurance treaty is the same as the coverage modifications of personal insurance introduced in Chapter 3. For a proportional reinsurance, the transformation \\(Y_{insurer} = c X\\) is identical to a coinsurance adjustment in personal insurance. For stop-loss reinsurance, the transformation \\(Y_{reinsurer} = \\max(0,X-M)\\) is the same as an insurer’s payment with a deductible \\(M\\) and \\(Y_{insurer} = \\min(X,M) = X \\wedge M\\) is equivalent to what a policyholder pays with deductible \\(M\\). For practical applications of the mathematics, in personal insurance the focus is generally upon the expectation as this is a key ingredient used in pricing. In contrast, for reinsurance the focus is on the entire distribution of the risk, as the extreme events are a primary concern of the financial stability of the insurer and reinsurer. This section describes the foundational and most basic of reinsurance treaties: Section 10.4.1 for proportional and Section 10.4.2 for non-proportional reinsurance. Section 10.4.3 gives a flavor of more complex contracts. 10.4.1 Proportional Reinsurance The simplest example of a proportional treaty is called quota shareA proportional treaty where the reinsurer receives a flat percent of the premium for the book of business reinsured and pays a percentage of losses, including allocated loss adjustment expenses. the reinsurer may also pays the ceding company a ceding commission which is designed to reflect the differences in underwriting expenses incurred.. In a quota share treaty, the reinsurer receives a flat percent, say 50%, of the premium for the book of business reinsured. In exchange, the reinsurer pays 50% of losses, including allocated loss adjustment expenses The reinsurer also pays the ceding company a ceding commission which is designed to reflect the differences in underwriting expenses incurred. The amounts paid by the direct insurer and the reinsurer are summarized as \\[ Y_{insurer} = c X \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ Y_{reinsurer} = (1-c) X, \\] where \\(c\\in (0,1)\\) denotes the proportion retained by the insurer. Note that \\(Y_{insurer}+Y_{reinsurer}=X\\). Example 10.4.1. Distribution of losses under quota share. To develop an intuition for the effect of quota-share agreement on the distribution of losses, the following is a short R demonstration using simulation. Note the relative shapes of the distributions of total losses, the retained portion (of the insurer), and the reinsurer’s portion. Show the R Code set.seed(2018) theta = 1000 alpha = 3 nSim = 10000 library(actuar) X &lt;- rpareto(nSim, shape = alpha, scale = theta) par(mfrow=c(1,3)) plot(density(X), xlim=c(0,3*theta), ylim=c(0,0.008), main=&quot;Total Loss&quot;, xlab=&quot;Losses&quot;) plot(density(0.75*X), xlim=c(0,3*theta), ylim=c(0,0.008), main=&quot;Insurer (75%)&quot;, xlab=&quot;Losses&quot;) plot(density(0.25*X), xlim=c(0,3*theta), ylim=c(0,0.008), main=&quot;Reinsurer (25%)&quot;, xlab=&quot;Losses&quot;) 10.4.1.1 Quota Share is Desirable for Reinsurers The quota share contract is particularly desirable for the reinsurer. To see this, suppose that an insurer and reinsurer wish to enter a contract to share total losses \\(X\\) such that \\[Y_{insurer}=g(X) \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ Y_{reinsurer}=X-g(X),\\] for some generic function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) (known as the retention function). Suppose further that the insurer only cares about the variability of retained claims and is indifferent to the choice of \\(g\\) as long as \\(Var(Y_{insurer})\\) stays the same and equals, say, \\(Q\\). Then, the following result shows that the quota share reinsurance treaty minimizes the reinsurer’s uncertainty as measured by \\(Var(Y_{reinsurer})\\). Proposition. Suppose that \\(Var(Y_{insurer})=Q.\\) Then, \\(Var ((1-c)X) \\le Var(g(X))\\) for all \\(g(.)\\), where \\(c=Q/Var(X)\\). Show the Justification of the Proposition Proof of the Proposition. With \\(Y_{reinsurer} = X - Y_{insurer}\\) and the law of total variation \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} Var (Y_{reinsurer}) &amp;= Var (X-Y_{insurer}) \\\\ &amp;= Var (X) + Var (Y_{insurer}) - 2 Cov (X,Y_{insurer}) \\\\ &amp;=Var (X) + Q - 2 Corr (X,Y_{insurer}) \\times \\sqrt{Q} \\sqrt{Var (X)} \\end{array} \\] In this expression, we see that \\(Q\\) and \\(Var(X)\\) do not change with the choice of \\(g\\). Thus, we can minimize \\(Var (Y_{reinsurer})\\) by maximizing the correlation \\(Corr (X,Y_{insurer})\\). If we use a quota share reinsurance agreement, then \\(Corr (X,Y_{insurer})=Corr (X,(1-c)X)=1\\), the maximum possible correlation. This establishes the proposition. \\(\\Box\\)` The proposition is intuitively appealing - with quota share insurance, the reinsurer shares the responsibility for very large claims in the tail of the distribution. This is in contrast to non-proportional agreements where reinsurers take responsibility for the very large claims. 10.4.1.2 Optimizing Quota Share Agreements for Insurers Now assume \\(n\\) risks in the porfolio, \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n,\\) so that the portfolio sum is \\(X= X_1 + \\cdots + X_n\\). For simplicity, we focus on the case of independent risks. Let us consider a variation of the basic quota share agreement where the amount retained by the insurer may vary with each risk, say \\(c_i\\). Thus, the insurer’s portion of the portfolio risk is \\(Y_{insurer} = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i X_i\\). What is the best choice of the proportions \\(c_i\\)? To formalize this question, we seek to find those values of \\(c_i\\) that minimize \\(Var (Y_{insurer})\\) subject to the constraint that \\(E (Y_{insurer}) = K.\\) The requirement that \\(E (Y_{insurer}) = K\\) suggests that the insurers wishes to retain a revenue in at least the amount of the constant \\(K\\). Subject to this revenue constraint, the insurer wishes to minimize the uncertainty of the retained risks as measured by the variance. Show the Optimal Retention Proportions The Optimal Retention Proportions Minimizing \\(Var(Y_{insurer})\\) subject to \\(E(Y_{insurer}) = K\\) is a constrained optimization problem - we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, a calculus technique, to solve this. To this end, define the Lagrangian \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} L &amp;= Var (Y_{insurer}) - \\lambda (E (Y_{insurer}) - K) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 ~Var(X_i) - \\lambda (\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i ~E(X_i) - K) \\end{array} \\] Taking a partial derivative with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) and setting this equal to zero simply means that the constraint, \\(E(Y_{insurer}) = K\\), is enforced and we have to choose the proportions \\(c_i\\) to satisfy this constraint. Moreover, taking the partial derivative with respect to each proportion \\(c_i\\) yields \\[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c_i} L = 2 c_i ~Var(X_i) - \\lambda ~E(X_i) = 0 \\] so that \\[ c_i = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\frac{E(X_i)}{Var(X_i)} . \\] With our constraint, we may determine \\(\\lambda\\) as the solution of \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} K &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^3 c_i \\mathrm{E}(X_i) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\mathrm{E}(X_i)^2}{Var(X_i)} \\end{array} \\] and use this value of \\(\\lambda\\) to determine the proportions. From the math, it turns out that the constant for the \\(i\\)th risk, \\(c_i\\) is proportional to \\(\\frac{E(X_i)}{Var (X_i)}\\). This is intuitively appealing. Other things being equal, a higher revenue as measured by \\(E (X_i)\\) means a higher value of \\(c_i\\). In the same way, a higher value of uncertainty as measured by \\(Var(X_i)\\) means a lower value of \\(c_i\\). The proportional scaling factor is determined by the revenue requirement \\(E(Y_{insurer}) = K\\). The following example helps to develop a feel for this relationship. Example 10.4.2. Three Pareto risks. Consider three risks that have a Pareto distribution. Provide a graph, and supporting code, that give values of \\(c_1\\), \\(c_2\\), and \\(c_3\\) for a required revenue \\(K\\). Note that these values increase linearly with \\(K\\).

Further, for claims for which \\(X &gt; M\\), the direct insurer pays \\(M\\) and the reinsurer pays the remaining amount \\(X-M\\). Thus, the insurer retains an amount \\(M\\) of the risk. Summarizing, the amounts paid by the direct insurer and the reinsurer are \\[ Y_{insurer} = \\begin{cases} X &amp; \\text{for } X \\le M\\\\ M &amp; \\text{for } X &gt;M \\\\ \\end{cases} \\ \\ \\ \\ = \\min(X,M) = X \\wedge M \\] and \\[ Y_{reinsurer} = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{for } X \\le M\\\\ X- M &amp; \\text{for } X &gt;M \\\\ \\end{cases} \\ \\ \\ \\ = \\max(0,X-M) . \\] As before, note that \\(Y_{insurer}+Y_{reinsurer}=X\\). The stop-loss type of contract is particularly desirable for the insurer. Similar to earlier, suppose that an insurer and reinsurer wish to enter a contract so that \\(Y_{insurer}=g(X)\\) and \\(Y_{reinsurer}=X-g(X)\\) for some generic retention functionA function that maps the insurer portfolio loss into the amount of loss retained by the insurer. \\(g(\\cdot)\\). Suppose further that the insurer only cares about the variability of retained claims and is indifferent to the choice of \\(g\\) as long as \\(Var(Y_{insurer})\\) can be minimized. Again, we impose the constraint that \\(E(Y_{insurer}) = K\\); the insurer needs to retain a revenue \\(K\\). Subject to this revenue constraint, the insurer wishes to minimize uncertainty of the retained risks (as measured by the variance). Then, the following result shows that the stop-loss reinsurance treaty minimizes the reinsurer’s uncertainty as measured by \\(Var(Y_{reinsurer})\\). Proposition. Suppose that \\(E(Y_{insurer})=K.\\) Then, \\(Var (X \\wedge M) \\le Var(g(X))\\) for all \\(g(.)\\), where \\(M\\) is such that \\(E(X \\wedge M)=K\\). Show the Justification of the Proposition Proof of the Proposition. Add and subtract a constant \\(M\\) and expand the square to get \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} Var(g(X)) &amp;= E (g(X) - K)^2 = E (g(X) -M +M- K)^2 \\\\ &amp;= E (g(X) -M)^2 + (M- K)^2 +2 E (g(X) -M)(M- K) \\\\ &amp;= E (g(X) -M)^2 - (M- K)^2 , \\end{array} \\] because \\(E(g(X))= K.\\) Now, for any retention function, we have \\(g(X) \\le X\\), that is, the insurer’s retained claims are less than or equal to total claims. Using the notation \\(g_{SL}(X) = X \\wedge M\\) for stop-loss insurance, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} M- g_{SL}(X) &amp;= M-(X \\wedge M) \\\\ &amp;= (M-X) \\wedge 0 \\\\ &amp;\\le (M-g(X)) \\wedge 0 . \\end{array} \\] Squaring each side yields \\[(M- g_{SL}(X))^2 \\le (M-g(X))^2 \\wedge 0 \\le (M-g(X))^2.\\] Returning to our expression for the variance, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} Var(g_{SL}(X)) &amp;= E (g_{SL}(X) -M)^2 - (M- K)^2 \\\\ &amp;\\le E (g(X) -M)^2 - (M- K)^2 = Var(g(X)) , \\end{array} \\] for any retention function \\(g\\). This establishes the proposition. \\(\\Box\\)` The proposition is intuitively appealing - with stop-loss insurance, the reinsurer takes the responsibility for very large claims in the tail of the distribution, not the insurer. 10.4.2.2 Excess of Loss A closely related form of non-proportional reinsurance is the excess of lossUnder an excess of loss arrangement, the insurer sets a retention level for each claim and pays claim amounts less than the level with the reinsurer paying the excess. coverage. Under this contract, we assume that the total risk \\(X\\) can be thought of as composed as \\(n\\) separate risks \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) and that each of these risks are subject to an upper limit, say, \\(M_i\\). So the insurer retains \\[ Y_{i,insurer} = X_i \\wedge M_i \\ \\ \\ \\ Y_{insurer} = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_{i,insurer} \\] and the reinsurer is responsible for the excess, \\(Y_{reinsurer}=X - Y_{insurer}\\). The retention limits may vary by risk or may be the same for all risks, \\(M_i =M\\), for all \\(i\\). 10.4.2.3 Optimal Choice for Excess of Loss Retention Limits What is the best choice of the excess of loss retention limits \\(M_i\\)? To formalize this question, we seek to find those values of \\(M_i\\) that minimize \\(Var(Y_{insurer})\\) subject to the constraint that \\(E(Y_{insurer}) = K.\\) Subject to this revenue constraint, the insurer wishes to minimize the uncertainty of the retained risks (as measured by the variance). Show the Optimal Retention Proportions The Optimal Retention Limits Minimizing \\(Var(Y_{insurer})\\) subject to \\(E(Y_{insurer}) = K\\) is a constrained optimization problem - we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, a calculus technique, to solve this. As before, define the Lagrangian \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} L &amp;= Var (Y_{insurer}) - \\lambda (E(Y_{insurer}) - K) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n ~Var (X_i \\wedge M_i) - \\lambda (\\sum_{i=1}^n ~E(X_i \\wedge M_i)- K). \\end{array} \\] We first recall the relationships \\[ E(X \\wedge M) = \\int_0^M ~(1- F(x))dx \\] and \\[ E(X \\wedge M)^2 = 2\\int_0^M ~x(1- F(x))dx. \\] Taking a partial derivative with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) and setting this equal to zero simply means that the constraint, \\(E(Y_{insurer}) = K\\), is enforced and we have to choose the limits \\(M_i\\) to satisfy this constraint. Moreover, taking the partial derivative with respect to each limit \\(M_i\\) yields \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M_i} L &amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M_i} ~Var(X_i \\wedge M_i) - \\lambda \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M_i} ~E(X_i \\wedge M_i) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M_i} \\left(E(X_i \\wedge M_i)^2 -(E(X_i \\wedge M_i))^2\\right) - \\lambda (1-F_i(M_i)) \\\\ &amp;= 2 M_i (1-F_i(M_i)) - 2 E(X_i \\wedge M_i) (1-F_i(M_i))- \\lambda (1-F_i(M_i)). \\end{array} \\] Setting \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M_i} L =0\\) and solving for \\(\\lambda\\), we get \\[ \\lambda = 2 (M_i - E(X_i \\wedge M_i)) . \\] From the math, it turns out that the retention limit less the expected insurer’s claims, \\(M_i - E(X_i \\wedge M_i)\\), is the same for all risks. This is intuitively appealing. Example 10.4.3. Excess of loss for three Pareto risks. Consider three risks that have a Pareto distribution, each having a different set of parameters (so they are independent but non-identical). Show numerically that the optimal retention limits \\(M_1\\), \\(M_2\\), and \\(M_3\\) resulting retention limit minus expected insurer’s claims, \\(M_i - E(X_i \\wedge M_i)\\), is the same for all risks, as we derived theoretically. Further, graphically compare the distribution of total risks to that retained by the insurer and by the reinsurer. Show an Example with Three Pareto Risks We first optimize the Lagrangian using the R package alabama for Augmented Lagrangian Adaptive Barrier Minimization Algorithm. theta1 = 1000;theta2 = 2000;theta3 = 3000; alpha1 = 3; alpha2 = 3; alpha3 = 4; Pmin &lt;- 2000 library(actuar) VarFct &lt;- function(M){ M1=M[1];M2=M[2];M3=M[3] mu1 &lt;- levpareto(limit=M1,shape=alpha1, scale=theta1, order=1) var1 &lt;- levpareto(limit=M1,shape=alpha1, scale=theta1, order=2)-mu1^2 mu2 &lt;- levpareto(limit=M2,shape=alpha2, scale=theta2, order=1) var2 &lt;- levpareto(limit=M2,shape=alpha2, scale=theta2, order=2)-mu2^2 mu3 &lt;- levpareto(limit=M3,shape=alpha3, scale=theta3, order=1) var3 &lt;- levpareto(limit=M3,shape=alpha3, scale=theta3, order=2)-mu3^2 varFct &lt;- var1 +var2+var3 meanFct &lt;- mu1+mu2+mu3 c(meanFct,varFct) } f &lt;- function(M){VarFct(M)[2]} h &lt;- function(M){VarFct(M)[1] - Pmin} library(alabama) par0=rep(1000,3) op &lt;- auglag(par=par0,fn=f,hin=h,control.outer=list(trace=FALSE)) The optimal retention limits \\(M_1\\), \\(M_2\\), and \\(M_3\\) resulting retention limit minus expected insurer’s claims, \\(M_i - E(X_i \\wedge M_i)\\), is the same for all risks, as we derived theoretically.

A surplus share treaty allows the reinsured to limit its exposure on any one risk to a given amount (the retained lineThe amount of exposure that the the reinsured retains on a given line in a surplus share reinsurance agreement.). The reinsurer assumes a part of the risk in proportion to the amount that the insured value exceeds the retained line, up to a given limit (expressed as a multiple of the retained line, or number of lines). For example, let the retained line be $100,000 and the given limit be 4 lines ($400,000). Then, if \\(X\\) is the loss, the reinsurer’s portion is \\(\\min(400000, (X-100000)_+)\\). 10.4.3.2 Layers of Coverage One can also extend non-proportional stop-loss treaties by introducing additional parties to the contract. For example, instead of simply an insurer and reinsurer or an insurer and a policyholder, think about the situation with all three parties, a policyholder, insurer, and reinsurer, who agree on how to share a risk. More generally, we consider \\(k\\) parties. If \\(k=3\\), it could be an insurer and two different reinsurers. Example 10.4.4. Layers of coverage for three parties. Suppose that there are \\(k=3\\) parties. The first party is responsible for the first 100 of claims, the second responsible for claims from 100 to 3000, and the third responsible for claims above 3000. If there are four claims in the amounts 50, 600, 1800 and 4000, then they would be allocated to the parties as follows: Layer Claim 1 Claim 2 Claim 3 Claim 4 Total (0, 100] 50 100 100 100 350 (100, 3000] 0 500 1700 2900 5100 (3000, \\(\\infty\\)) 0 0 0 1000 1000 Total 50 600 1800 4000 6450 To handle the general situation with \\(k\\) groups, partition the positive real line into \\(k\\) intervals using the cut-points \\[0 = M_0 &lt; M_1 &lt; \\cdots &lt; M_{k-1} &lt; M_k = \\infty.\\] Note that the \\(j\\)th interval is \\((M_{j-1}, M_j]\\). Now let \\(Y_j\\) be the amount of risk shared by the \\(j\\)th party. To illustrate, if a loss \\(x\\) is such that \\(M_{j-1} &lt;x \\le M_j\\), then \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{c} Y_1\\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_j \\\\Y_{j+1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\Y_k \\end{array}\\right) =\\left(\\begin{array}{c} M_1-M_0 \\\\ M_2-M_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x-M_{j-1} \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\0 \\end{array}\\right)\\] More succinctly, we can write \\[Y_j = \\min(X,M_j) - \\min(X,M_{j-1}) .\\] With the expression \\(Y_j = \\min(X,M_j) - \\min(X,M_{j-1})\\), we see that the \\(j\\)th party is responsible for claims in the interval \\((M_{j-1}, M_j].\\) With this, it is easy to check that \\(X = Y_1 + Y_2 + \\cdots + Y_k.\\) As emphasized in the following example, we also remark that the parties need not be different. Example 10.4.5. - Suppose that a policyholder is responsible for the first 500 of claims and all claims in excess of 100,000. The insurer takes claims between 100 and 100,000. - Then, we would use \\(M_1 = 100\\), \\(M_2 =100000\\). - The policyholder is responsible for \\(Y_1 =\\min(X,100)\\) and \\(Y_3 = X - \\min(X,100000) = \\max(0, X-100000)\\). For additional reading, see the Wisconsin Property Fund site for an example on layers of reinsurance. 10.4.3.3 Portfolio Management Example Many other variations of the foundational contracts are possible. For one more illustration, consider the following. Example. 10.4.6. Portfolio management. You are the Chief Risk Officer of a telecommunications firm. Your firm has several property and liability risks. We will consider: \\(X_1\\) - buildings, modeled using a gamma distribution with mean 200 and scale parameter 100. \\(X_2\\) - motor vehicles, modeled using a gamma distribution with mean 400 and scale parameter 200. \\(X_3\\) - directors and executive officers risk, modeled using a Pareto distribution with mean 1000 and scale parameter 1000. \\(X_4\\) - cyber risks, modeled using a Pareto distribution with mean 1000 and scale parameter 2000. Denote the total risk as \\[X = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 .\\] For simplicity, you assume that these risks are independent. To manage the risk, you seek some insurance protection. You wish to manage internally small building and motor vehicles amounts, up to \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\), respectively. You seek insurance to cover all other risks. Specifically, the insurer’s portion is \\[ Y_{insurer} = (X_1 - M_1)_+ + (X_2 - M_2)_+ + X_3 + X_4 ,\\] so that your retained risk is \\(Y_{retained}= X- Y_{insurer} =\\) \\(\\min(X_1,M_1) + \\min(X_2,M_2)\\). Using deductibles \\(M_1=\\) 100 and \\(M_2=\\) 200: Determine the expected claim amount of (i) that retained, (ii) that accepted by the insurer, and (iii) the total overall amount. Determine the 80th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles for (i) that retained, (ii) that accepted by the insurer, and (iii) the total overall amount. Compare the distributions by plotting the densities for (i) that retained, (ii) that accepted by the insurer, and (iii) the total overall amount.

This chapter introduces loss reserving (also known as claims reserving) for property and casualty (P&amp;C, or general, non-life) insurance products. In particular, the chapter sketches some basic, though essential, analytic tools to assess the reserves on a portfolio of P&amp;C insurance products. First, Section 11.1 motivates the need for loss reserving, then Section 11.2 studies the available data sources and introduces some formal notation to tackle loss reserving as a prediction challenge. Next, Section 11.3 covers the chain-ladder method and Mack’s distribution-free chain-ladder model. Section 11.4 then develops a fully stochastic approach to determine the outstanding reserve with generalized linear models (GLMs), including the technique of bootstrapping to obtain a predictive distribution of the outstanding reserve via simulation. 11.1 Motivation Our starting point is the lifetime of a P&amp;C insurance claim. Figure 11.1 pictures the development of such a claim over time and identifies the events of interest: Figure 11.1: Lifetime or run-off of a claim The insured event or accident occurs at time \\(t_{occ}\\). This incident is reported to the insurance company at time \\(t_{rep}\\), after some delay. If the filed claim is accepted by the insurance company, payments will follow to reimburse the financial loss of the policyholder. In this example the insurance company compensates the incurred loss with loss payments at times \\(t_1\\), \\(t_2\\) and \\(t_3\\). Eventually, the claim settles or closes at time \\(t_{set}\\). Often claims will not settle immediately due to the presence of delay in the reporting of a claim, delay in the settlement process or both. The reporting delayThe time that elapses between the occurrence of the insured event and the reporting of this event to the insurance company. is the time that elapses between the occurrence of the insured event and the reporting of this event to the insurance company. The time between reporting and settlement of a claim is known as the settlement delayThe time between reporting and settlement of a claim.. For example, it is very intuitive that a material damage claim settles quicker than a bodily injury claim involving a complex type of injury. Closed claims may also reopen due to new developments, e.g. an injury that requires extra treatment. Put together, the development of a claim typically takes some time. The presence of this delay in the run-off of a claim requires the insurer to hold capital in order to settle these claims in the future. 11.1.1 Closed, IBNR, and RBNS Claims Based on the status of the claim’s run-off we distinguish three types of claims in the books of an insurance company. A first type of claim is a closed claim. For these claims the complete development has been observed. With the red line in Figure 11.2 indicating the present moment, all events from the claim’s development take place before the present moment. Hence, these events are observed at the present moment. For convenience, we will assume that a closed claim can not reopen. Figure 11.2: Lifetime of a closed claim An RBNSReported, But is Not fully Settled claim is one that has been Reported, But is Not fully Settled at the present moment or the moment of evaluation, that is, the moment when the reserves should be calculated and booked by the insurer. Occurrence, reporting and possibly some loss payments take place before the present moment, but the closing of the claim happens in the future, beyond the present moment. Figure 11.3: Lifetime of an RBNS claim An IBNR Incurred in the past But is Not yet Reported. For such a claim the insured event took place, but the insurance company is not yet aware of the associated claim. claim is one that has Incurred in the past But is Not yet Reported. For such a claim the insured event took place, but the insurance company is not yet aware of the associated claim. This claim will be reported in the future and its complete development (from reporting to settlement) takes place in the future. Figure 11.4: Lifetime of an IBNR claim Insurance companies will reserve capital to fulfill their future liabilities with respect to both RBNS as well as IBNR claims. The future development of such claims is uncertain and predictive modeling techniques will be used to calculate appropriate reserves, from the historical development data observed on similar claims. 11.1.2 Why Reserving? The inverted production cycle of the insurance market and the claim dynamics pictured in Section 11.1.1 motivate the need for reserving and the design of predictive modeling tools to estimate reserves. In insurance, the premium income precedes the costs. An insurer will charge a client a premium, before actually knowing how costly the insurance policy or contract will become. In typical manufacturing industry this is not the case and the manufacturer knows - before selling a product - what the cost of producing this product was. At a specified evaluation moment \\(\\tau\\) the insurer will predict his outstanding liabilities with respect to contracts sold in the past. This is the claims reserve or loss reserve; it is the capital necessary to settle open claims from past exposures. It is a very important element on the balance sheet of the insurer, more specifically on the liabilities side of this balance sheet. 11.2 Loss Reserve Data 11.2.1 From Micro to Macro We now shed light on the data available to estimate the outstanding reserve for a portfolio of P&amp;C contracts. Insurance companies typically register data on the development of an individual claim as sketched in the timeline on the left hand side of Figure 11.5. We refer to data registered at this level as granular or micro-level data. Typically, an actuary aggregates the information registered on the individual development of claims across all claims in a portfolio. This aggregation leads to data structured in a triangular format as shown on the right hand side of Figure 11.5. Such data are called aggregate or macro-level data because each cell in the triangle displays information obtained by aggregating the development of multiple claims. Figure 11.5: From granular data to run-off triangle The triangular display used in loss reserving is called a run-off or development triangle. On the vertical axis the triangle lists the accident or occurrence years during which a portfolio is followed. The loss payments booked for a specific claim are connected to the year during the which the insured event occurred. The horizontal axis indicates the payment delay since occurrence of the insured event. 11.2.2 Run-off Triangles A first example of a run-off triangleTriangular display of loss reserve data. Accident or occurrence periods on one axis (often vertical) with development periods on the other (often horizontal). Also known as a development triangle. with incremental payments is displayed in Figure 11.6 (taken from Wüthrich and Merz (2008), Table 2.2, also used in Wüthrich and Merz (2015), Table 1.4). Accident years (or years of occurrence) are shown on the vertical axis and run from 2004 up to 2013. These refer to the year during which the insured event occurred. The horizontal axis indicates the payment delay in years since occurrence of the insured event. 0 delay is used for payments made in the year of occurrence of the accident or insured event. One year of delay is used for payments made in the year after occurrence of the accident. Figure 11.6: A run-off triangle with incremental payment data. Source: Wüthrich and Merz (2008), Table 2.2. For example, cell \\((2004, 0)\\) in the above triangle displays the number \\(5,947\\), the total amount paid in the year 2004 for all claims occurring in year 2004. Thus, it is the total amount paid with 0 years of delay on all claims that occurred in the year 2004. Similarly, the number in cell \\((2012,1)\\) displays the total \\(2,357.9\\) paid in the year 2013 for all claims that occurred in year 2012. Figure 11.7: A run-off triangle with cumulative payment data. Source: Wüthrich and Merz (2008), Table 2.2. Whereas the triangle in Figure 11.6 displays incremental payment data, the Figure 11.7 shows the same information in cumulative format. Now, cell \\((2004,1)\\) displays the total claim amount paid up to payment delay 1 for all claims that occurred in year 2004. Therefore, it is the sum of the amount paid in 2004 and the amount paid in 2005 on accidents that occurred in 2004. Different pieces of information can be stored in run-off triangles as those shown in Figure 11.6 and Figure 11.7. Depending on the kind of data stored, the triangle will be used to estimate different quantities. For example, in incremental format a cell may display: the claim payments, as motivated before the number of claims that occurred in a specific year and were reported with a certain delay, when the goal is to estimate the number of IBNR claims the change in incurred amounts, where incurred claim amounts are the sum of cumulative paid claims and the case estimatesThe claims handlers expert estimate of the outstanding amount on a claim.. The case estimate is the claims handler’s expert estimate of the outstanding amount on a claim. In cumulative format a cell may display: the cumulative paid amount, as motivated before the total number of claims from an occurrence year, reported up to a certain delay the incurred claim amounts. Other sources of information are potentially available, e.g. covariates (like the type of claim), external information (like inflation, change in regulation). Most claims reserving methods designed for run-off triangles are rather based on a single source of information, although recent contributions focus on the use of more detailed data for loss reserving. 11.2.3 Loss Reserve Notation Run-off Triangles To formalize the displays shown in Figures 11.6 and 11.7, we let \\(i\\) refer to the occurrence or accident year, the year in which the insured event happened. In our notation the first accident year considered in the portfolio is denoted with 1 and the latest, most recent accident year is denoted with \\(I\\). Then, \\(j\\) refers to the payment delay or development year, where a delay equal to 0 corresponds to the accident year itself. Figure 11.8 shows a triangle where the same number of years is considered in both the vertical as well as the horizontal direction, hence \\(j\\) runs from 0 up to \\(J = I-1\\). Figure 11.8: Mathematical notation for a run-off triangle. Source: Wüthrich and Merz (2008) The random variable \\(X_{ij}\\) denotes the incremental claims paid in development period \\(j\\) on claims from accident year \\(i\\). Thus, \\(X_{ij}\\) is the total amount paid in development year \\(j\\) for all claims that happened in occurrence year \\(i\\). These payments are actually paid out in accounting or calendar year \\(i+j\\). Taking a cumulative point of view, \\(C_{ij}\\) is the cumulative amount paid up until (and including) development year \\(j\\) for accidents that occurred in year \\(i\\). Ultimately, a total amount \\(C_{iJ}\\) is paid in the final development year \\(J\\) for claims that occurred in accident year \\(i\\). In this chapter time is expressed in years, though other time units can be used as well, e.g. semesters or quarters. The Loss Reserve At the evaluation moment \\(\\tau\\), the data in the upper triangle have been observed, whereas the lower triangle has to be predicted. Here, the evaluation moment is the end of accident year \\(I\\) which implies that a cell \\((i,j)\\) with \\(i+j \\leq I\\) is observed, and a cell \\((i,j)\\) with \\(i+j &gt; I\\) belongs to the future and has to be predicted. Thus, for a cumulative run-off triangle, the goal of a loss reserving method is to predict \\(C_{i,I-1}\\), the ultimate claim amount for occurrence year \\(i\\), corresponding to the final development period \\(I-1\\) in Figure 11.7. We assume that - beyond this period - no further payments will follow, although this assumption can be relaxed. Since \\(C_{i,I-1}\\) is cumulative, it includes both an observed part as well as a part that has to be predicted. Therefore, the outstanding liability or loss reserve for accident year \\(i\\) is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathcal{R}^{(0)}_{i} = \\sum_{\\ell=I-i+1}^{I-1} X_{i\\ell} = C_{i,I}-C_{i,I-i}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We express the reserve either as a sum of incremental data, the \\(X_{i\\ell}\\), or as a difference between cumulative numbers. In the latter case the outstanding amount is the ultimate cumulative amount \\(C_{i,I}\\) minus the most recently observed cumulative amount \\(C_{i,I-i}\\). Following Wüthrich and Merz (2015), the notation \\(\\mathcal{R}^{(0)}_{i}\\) refers to the reserve for occurrence year \\(i\\) where \\(i=1,\\ldots,I\\). The superscript \\((0)\\) refers to the evaluation of the reserve at the present moment, say \\(\\tau = 0\\). We understand \\(\\tau = 0\\) at the end of occurrence year \\(I\\), the most recent calendar year for which data are observed and registered. 11.2.4 R Code to Summarize Loss Reserve Data We use the ChainLadder package (Gesmann et al. 2019) to import run-off triangles in R and to explore the trends present in these triangles. The package’s vignette nicely documents its functions for working with triangular data. First, we explore two ways to import a triangle. Long Format Data The dataset triangle_W_M_long.txt stores the cumulative run-off triangle from Wüthrich and Merz (2008) (Table 2.2) in long format. That is: each cell in the triangle is one row in this data set, and three features are stored: the payment size (cumulative, in this example), the year of occurrence (\\(i\\)) and the payment delay (\\(j\\)).

Visualizing Triangles To explore the evolution of the cumulative payments per occurrence year, Figure 11.9 shows my_triangle using the plot function available for objects of type triangle in the ChainLadder package. Each line in this plot pictures an occurrence year (from 2004 to 2013, labelled as 1 to 10). Development periods are labelled from 1 to 10 (instead of 0 to 9, as used above). plot(my_triangle) Figure 11.9: Claim Development by Occurrence Year Alternatively, the lattice argument creates one plot per occurrence year. plot(my_triangle, lattice = TRUE) Instead of plotting the cumulative triangle stored in my_triangle, we can plot the incremental run-off triangle. plot(my_triangle_incr) plot(my_triangle_incr, lattice = TRUE) 11.3 The Chain-Ladder The most widely used method to estimate outstanding loss reserves is the so-called chain-ladder methodAn algorithm for predicting incomplete losses to their ultimate cumulative value. The name refers to the chaining of a sequence of (year-to-year development) factors into a ladder of factors.. The origins of this method are obscure but was firmly entrenched in practical applications by the early 1970’s, Taylor (1986). As will be seen, the name refers to the chaining of a sequence of (year-to-year development) factors into a ladder of factors; immature losses climb toward maturity when multiplied by this concatenation of ratios, hence the apt description chain-ladder method. We will start with exploring the chain-ladder method in its deterministic or algorithmic version, hence without making any stochastic assumptions. Then we will describe Mack’s distribution-free chain-ladder model. 11.3.1 The Deterministic Chain-Ladder The deterministic chain-ladder method focuses on the run-off triangle in cumulative form. Recall that a cell \\((i,j)\\) in this triangle displays the cumulative amount paid up until development period \\(j\\) for claims that occurred in year \\(i\\). The chain-ladder method assumes that development factors \\(f_j\\) (also called age-to-age factors, link ratios or chain-ladder factors) exist such that \\[ C_{i,j+1} = f_j \\times C_{i,j}. \\] Thus, the development factor tells you how the cumulative amount in development year \\(j\\) grows to the cumulative amount in year \\(j+1\\). We highlight the cumulative amount in period 0 in and the cumulative amount in period 1 in on the Figure 11.10 taken from Wüthrich and Merz (2008) (Table 2.2, also used in Wüthrich and Merz (2015), Table 1.4). Figure 11.10: A run-off triangle with cumulative payment data highlighting the cumulative amount in period 0 in blue and the cumulative amount in period 1 in red. Source: Wüthrich and Merz (2008), Table 2.2. The chain-ladder method then presents an intuitive recipe to estimate or calculate these development factors. Since the first development factor \\(f_0\\) describes the development of the cumulative claim amount from development period 0 to development period 1, it can be estimated as the ratio of the cumulative amounts in red and the cumulative amounts in blue, highlighted in the Figure 11.10. In math notation we then obtain the following estimate \\(\\hat{f}_0^{CL}\\) for the first development factor \\(f_0\\), given observations \\(\\mathcal{D}_I\\): \\[ \\hat{f}^{CL}_{\\color{magenta}{0}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{10-\\color{magenta}{0}-1} \\color{red}{C_{i,\\color{magenta}{0}+1}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{10-\\color{magenta}{0}-1} \\color{blue}{C_{i\\color{magenta}{0}}}}= 1.4925. \\] Note that the index \\(i\\), used in the sums in the numerator and denominator, runs from the first occurrence period (1) to the last occurrence period (9) for which both development periods 0 and 1 are observed. As such, this development factor measures how the data in blue grow to the data in red, averaged across all occurrence periods for which both periods are observed. The chain-ladder method then uses this development factor estimator to predict the cumulative amount \\(C_{10,1}\\) (i.e. the cumulative amount paid up until and including development year 1 for accidents that occurred in year 10). This prediction is obtained by multiplying the most recent observed cumulative claim amount for occurrence period 10 (i.e. \\(C_{10,0}\\) with development period 0) with the estimated development factor \\(\\hat{f}^{CL}_0\\): \\[ \\hat{C}_{10, 1} = C_{10,0} \\cdot \\hat{f}^{CL}_0 = 5,676\\cdot 1.4925=8,471. \\] Going forward with this reasoning, the next development factor \\(f_1\\) can be estimated. Since \\(f_1\\) captures the development from period 1 to period 2, it can be estimated as the ratio of the numbers in red and the numbers in blue as highlighted in Figure 11.11. Figure 11.11: A run-off triangle with cumulative payment data highlighting the cumulative amount in period 1 in blue and the cumulative amount in period 2 in red. Source: Wüthrich and Merz (2008), Table 2.2. The mathematical notation of the estimate \\(\\hat{f}_1^{CL}\\) for the next development factor \\(f_1\\), given observations \\(\\mathcal{D}_I\\), equals: \\[ \\hat{f}^{CL}_{\\color{magenta}{1}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{10-\\color{magenta}{1}-1} \\color{red}{C_{i,\\color{magenta}{1}+1}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{10-\\color{magenta}{1}-1} \\color{blue}{C_{i\\color{magenta}{1}}}}=1.0778. \\] Consequently, this factor measures how the cumulative paid amount in development period 1 grows to period 2, averaged across all occurrence periods for which both periods are observed. The index \\(i\\) now runs from period 1 to 8, since these are the occurrence periods for which both development periods 1 and 2 are observed. This estimate for the second development factor is then used to predict the missing, unobserved cells in development period 2: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} \\hat{C}_{10,2} &amp;= C_{10,0} \\cdot \\hat{f}^{CL}_0 \\cdot \\hat{f}_1^{CL} = \\hat{C}_{10,1} \\cdot \\hat{f}_1^{CL} = 8,471 \\cdot 1.0778 = 9,130 \\\\ \\hat{C}_{9,2} &amp;= C_{9,1} \\cdot \\hat{f}^{CL}_1 = 7,649 \\cdot 1.0778 = 8,244. \\end{array} \\] Note that for \\(\\hat{C}_{10,2}\\) you actually use the estimate \\(\\hat{C}_{10,1}\\) and multiply it with the estimated development factor \\(\\hat{f}_1^{CL}\\). We continue analogously and obtain following predictions, printed in italics in the Figure 11.12: Figure 11.12: A run-off triangle with cumulative payment data including predictions in italic. Source: (Wüthrich and Merz 2008), Table 2.2. Eventually we need to estimate the values in the final column. The last development factor \\(f_8\\) measures the growth from development period 8 to development period 9 in the triangle. Since only the first row in the triangle has both cells observed, this last factor is estimated as the ratio of the value in red and the value in blue in Figure 11.13. Figure 11.13: A run-off triangle with cumulative payment data highlighting the cumulative amount in period 8 in blue and the cumulative amount in period 9 in red. Source: (Wüthrich and Merz 2008), Table 2.2. Given observations \\(\\mathcal{D}_I\\), this factor estimate \\(\\hat{f}^{CL}_{8}\\) is equal to: \\[ \\hat{f}^{CL}_{\\color{magenta}{8}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{10-\\color{magenta}{8}-1} \\color{red}{C_{i,\\color{magenta}{8}+1}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{10-\\color{magenta}{8}-1} \\color{blue}{C_{i\\color{magenta}{8}}}}=1.001. \\] Typically this last development factor is close to 1 and hence the cash flows paid in the final development period are minor. Using this development factor estimate, we can now estimate the remaining cumulative claim amounts in the column by multiplying the values for development year 8 with this factor. The general math notation for the chain ladder predictions for the lower triangle (\\(i+j&gt;I\\)) is as follows: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} \\hat{C}_{ij}^{CL} &amp;= C_{i,I-i} \\cdot \\prod_{l=I-i}^{j-1} \\hat{f}_l^{CL} \\\\ \\hat{f}_j^{CL} &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{I-j-1} C_{i,j+1}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{I-j-1} C_{ij}}, \\end{array} \\] where \\(C_{i,I-i}\\) is on the last observed diagonal. It is clear that an important assumption of the chain-ladder method is that the proportional developments of claims from one development period to the next are similar for all occurrence years. This yields the following Figure 11.14: Figure 11.14: A run-off triangle with cumulative payment data including predictions in italic. Source: Wüthrich and Merz (2008), Table 2.2. The numbers in the last column show the estimates for the ultimate claim amounts. The estimate for the outstanding claim amount \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{R}}_i^{CL}\\) for a particular occurrence period \\(i=I-J+1,\\ldots, I\\) is then given by the difference between the ultimate claim amount and the cumulative amount as observed on the most recent diagonal: \\[ \\hat{\\mathcal{R}}_i^{CL} =\\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL}-C_{i,I-i}. \\] This is the chain-ladder estimate for the reserve necessary to fulfill future liabilities with respect to claims that occurred in this particular occurrence period. These reserves per occurrence period and for the total summed over all occurrence periods are summarized in Figure 11.15. Figure 11.15: Reserves per occurence period and for total 11.3.2 Mack’s Distribution-Free Chain-Ladder Model At this stage, the traditional chain-ladder method provides a point estimator \\(\\hat{C}^{CL}_{iJ}\\) for the forecast of \\(C_{iJ}\\), using the information \\(\\mathcal{D}_I\\). Since the chain-ladder method is a purely deterministic and intuitively natural algorithm to complete a run-off triangle, we are not able to determine how reliable that point estimator is or to model the variation of the future payments. To answer such questions an underlying stochastic model that reproduces the chain-ladder reserve estimates is needed. In this section we will focus on the distribution-free chain-ladder model as an underlying stochastic model, introduced in Mack (1993). This method allows us to estimate the standard errors of the chain-ladder predictions. In the next Section 11.4, generalized linear models are used to develop a fully stochastic approach for predicting the outstanding reserve. In Mack’s approach the following conditions (without assuming a distribution) hold: Cumulative claims \\((C_{ij})_{j=0,\\ldots,J}\\) are independent over different occurrence periods \\(i\\). There exist fixed constants \\(f_0, \\ldots, f_{J-1}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_0,\\ldots, \\sigma^2_{J-1}\\) such that for all \\(i=1,\\ldots, I\\) and \\(j=0,\\ldots,J-1\\): \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} E[C_{i,j+1}|C_{i0},\\ldots,C_{ij}] &amp;= f_j \\cdot C_{ij} \\\\ \\text{Var}(C_{i,j+1}|C_{ij}) &amp;= \\sigma^2_j \\cdot C_{ij}. \\end{array} \\] This means that the cumulative claims \\((C_{ij})_{j=0,\\ldots,J}\\) are Markov processes (in the development periods \\(j\\)) and hence the future only depends on the present. Under these assumptions, the expected value of the ultimate claim amount \\(C_{i,J}\\), given the available data in the upper triangle, is the cumulative amount on the most recent diagonal (\\(C_{i, I-1}\\)) multiplied with appropriate development factors \\(f_j\\). In mathematical notation we obtain for known development factors \\(f_j\\) and observations \\(\\mathcal{D}_I\\): \\[ E[C_{iJ}|\\mathcal{D}_I] = C_{i,I-i} \\prod_{j=I-i}^{J-1} f_j. \\] This is exactly what the deterministic chain-ladder method does, as explained in Section 11.3.1. In practice, the development factors are not known and need to be estimated from the data that is available in the upper triangle. In Mack’s approach we obtain exactly the same expression for estimating the development factors \\(f_j\\) at time \\(I\\) as in the deterministic chain-ladder algorithm: \\[ \\hat{f}_j^{CL} =\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{I-j-1} C_{i,j+1}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{I-j-1} C_{ij}}. \\] The predictions for the cells in the lower triangle (i.e. for cells $C_{i,j} $where \\(i+j&gt;I\\)) are then obtained by replacing the unknown factors \\(f_j\\) by their corresponding estimates \\(\\hat{f}_j^{CL}\\): \\[ \\hat{C}^{CL}_{ij} = C_{i,I-i}\\prod_{l=I-i}^{j-1} \\hat{f}_l^{CL}. \\] To quantify the prediction error that comes with the chain-ladder predictions, Mack also introduced variance parameters \\(\\sigma^2_j\\). To gain insight in the estimation of these variance parameters, so-called individual development factors \\(f_{i,j}\\) are introduced (which are specific to occurrence period \\(i\\)): \\[ f_{i,j} = \\frac{C_{i,j+1}}{C_{ij}}. \\] These individual development also describe how the cumulative amount grows from period \\(j\\) to period \\(j+1\\), but they consider the ratio of only two cells (instead of taking the ratio of two sums over all available occurrence periods). Note that the development factors can be written as a weighted average of individual development factors: \\[ \\hat{f}_j^{CL} = \\sum_{i=1}^{I-j-1} \\frac{C_{ij}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{I-j-1} C_{ij}} f_{i,j}, \\] where the weights are equal to the cumulative claims \\(C_{ij}\\). Let us now estimate the variance parameters \\(\\sigma^2\\) by writing Mack’s variance assumption in equivalent ways. First, the variance of the ratio of \\(C_{i,j+1}\\) and \\(c_{i,j}\\) conditional on \\(C_{i,0},\\ldots, C_{i,j}\\) is proportional to the inverse of \\(C_{i,j}\\): \\[ \\text{Var}[C_{i,j+1}/C_{ij}|C_{i0},\\ldots,C_{ij}] ~ \\propto ~ \\frac{1}{C_{ij}}. \\] This reminds us of a typical weighted least squares setting where the weights are the inverse of the variability of a response. Therefore, a more volatile or imprecise response variable will get less weight. The \\(C_{i,j}\\) play the role of the weights. Using the unknown variance parameter \\(\\sigma^2_j\\) this variance assumption can be written as: \\[ \\text{Var}[C_{i,j+1}|C_{i0},\\ldots,C_{ij}] = \\sigma^2_j \\cdot C_{ij}, \\] The connection with weighted least squares then directly leads to an unbiased estimate for the unknown variance parameter \\(\\sigma^2_j\\) in the form of a weighted residual sum of squares: \\[ \\hat{\\sigma}^2_j = \\frac{1}{I-j-2}\\sum_{i=1}^{I-j-1} C_{ij}\\left(\\frac{C_{i,j+1}}{C_{ij}}-\\hat{f}_j^{CL}\\right)^2. \\] The weights are again equal to \\(C_{i,j}\\) and the residuals are the differences between the ratios \\(C_{i,j+1}/C_{i,j}\\) and the individual development factors. We now have all ingredients required to calibrate the distribution-free chain-ladder model to the data. The next step is then to analyze the prediction uncertainty and the prediction error. Hereto we use the chain-ladder predictor where we replace the unknown development factors with their estimators: \\[ \\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL} = C_{i,I-i} \\prod_{l=I-i}^{J-1} \\hat{f}_l^{CL} \\] We use this expression either as an estimator for the conditional expectation of the ultimate claim amount (given the observed upper triangle) or as a predictor for the ultimate claim amount as a random variable (given the observed upper triangle). In statistics the simplest measure to analyze the uncertainty that comes with a point estimate or prediction is the Mean Squared Error of Prediction (MSEP). Here we consider a conditional MSEP, conditional on the data observed in the upper triangle: \\[ MSEP_{C_{iJ}|\\mathcal{D}_I}\\left(\\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL}\\right) = E\\left[\\left(C_{iJ}-\\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL}\\right)^2|\\mathcal{D}_I\\right]. \\] This conditional MSEP measures: the distance between the (true) ultimate claim \\(C_{iJ}\\) and its chain-ladder predictor \\(\\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL}\\) at time \\(I\\), and the total prediction uncertainty over the entire run-off of the nominal ultimate claim \\(C_{iJ}\\). It does not consider time value of money, a risk margin nor any dynamics in its developments. The MSEP that comes with the estimate for the ultimate cumulative claim amount is equal to the MSEP that measures the squared distance between the true and the estimated reserve: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} MSEP_{\\hat{\\mathcal{R}}^{I}_{i}|\\mathcal{D}_I}(\\hat{\\mathcal{R}}^{I}_i) &amp;= E[(\\hat{\\mathcal{R}}^I_i-\\mathcal{R}^I_i)^2|\\mathcal{D}_I] \\\\ &amp;= E[(\\hat{C}^{CL}_{iJ}-C_{iJ})^2|\\mathcal{D}_I] = MSEP(\\hat{C}_{iJ}). \\end{array} \\] The reason for this equivalence is the fact that the reserve is the ultimate claim amount minus the most recently observed claim amount. The latter is observed and used in both \\(\\mathcal{R}^I_i\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{R}}^I_i\\). It is interesting to decompose this MSEP into a component that captures process variance and a component that captures parameter estimation variance: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} MSEP_{C_{iJ|\\mathcal{D}_I}}\\left(\\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL}\\right) &amp;= E\\left[ \\left( C_{iJ} - \\hat{C}_{iJ} \\right)^2 | \\mathcal{D}_I\\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\text{Var}(C_{iJ}|\\mathcal{D}_I) + \\left( E[C_{iJ}|\\mathcal{D}_I]-\\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL} \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\color{magenta}{\\text{process variance}} + \\color{magenta}{\\text{parameter estimation variance}}, \\end{array} \\] for a \\(\\mathcal{D}_I\\) measurable estimator/predictor \\(\\hat{C}_{iJ}\\). The process variance component captures the volatility or uncertainty in the random variable \\(C_{i,J}\\) and the parameter estimation variance measures the error that arises from replacing the unknown development factors \\(f_j\\) with their estimated values. This result follows immediately from following equality about the variance of a shifted random variable \\(X\\) where the shift \\(a\\) is deterministic: \\[ E(X-a)^2 = \\text{Var}(X)+\\left[EX-a\\right]^2. \\] Applied to the expression of the MSEP you treat \\(\\hat{C}_{i,J}\\) as fixed because you work conditionally on the data in the upper triangle and \\(\\hat{C}_{i,J}\\) only uses information from this upper triangle. Mack (1993) then derived the important formula for the conditional MSEP in the distribution-free chain-ladder model for a single occurrence period \\(i\\): \\[ \\widehat{MSEP_{C_{iJ}|\\mathcal{D}_I}} = \\left(\\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL}\\right)^2 \\sum_{j=I-i}^{J-1} \\left[ \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_j^2}{(\\hat{f}_j^{CL})^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{C}^{CL}_{ij}}+\\frac{1}{\\sum_{n=1}^{I-j-1}C_{nj}}\\right)\\right]. \\] For the derivation of this popular formula, we refer to his paper. Note that it is an estimate of the MSEP since the unknown parameters \\(f_j\\) and \\(\\sigma_j\\) need to be estimated and since the estimation error cannot be calculated explicitly. Mack also derived a formula for the MSEP for the total reserve, across all occurrence periods: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\widehat{MSEP_{\\sum_{i=1}^I \\hat{C}^{CL}_{iJ}}}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^I \\hat{C}^{CL}_{iJ} \\right) \\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\sum_{i=1}^I \\widehat{MSEP_{C_{iJ}|\\mathcal{D}_I}}\\left( \\hat{C}^{CL}_{iJ} \\right) \\color{blue}{+2 \\sum_{1\\leq i&lt; k \\leq I} \\hat{C}_{iJ}^{CL} \\hat{C}_{kJ}^{CL} \\sum_{j=I-i}^{J-1} \\frac{ \\hat{\\sigma}_j^2/\\left( \\hat{f}_j^{\\text{CL}} \\right)^2 }{ \\sum_{n=1}^{I-j-1} C_{nj} }}. \\end{array} \\] The result is the sum of the MSEPs per occurrence period plus a covariance term.

The distribution-free chain-ladder model of Mack (1993) is implemented in the ChainLadder package (Gesmann et al. 2019) (as a special form of weighted least squares) and can be applied on the data my_triangle to predict outstanding claim amounts and to estimate the standard error around those forecasts.

The top right-hand plot shows the forecasted development patterns for all occurrence periods (starting with 1 for the oldest occurrence period). When setting the argument lattice=TRUE we obtain a plot of the development, including the prediction and estimated standard errors by occurrence period: plot(CL, lattice=TRUE) 11.4 GLMs and Bootstrap for Loss Reserves This section is being written and is not yet complete nor edited. It is here to give you a flavor of what will be in the final version. This section covers regression models to analyze run-off triangles. When analyzing the data in a run-off triangle with a regression model, the standard toolbox for model building, estimation and prediction becomes available. Using these tools we are able to go beyond the point estimate and standard error as derived in Section 11.3. More specifically, we build a generalized linear model (GLMGeneralized linear model) for the incremental payments \\(X_{ij}\\) in Figure 11.6. Whereas the chain-ladder method works with cumulative data, typical GLMs assume the response variables to be independent and therefore work with incremental run-off triangles. 11.4.1 Model Specification Let \\(X_{ij}\\) denote the incremental payment in cell \\((i,j)\\) of the run-off triangle. We assume the \\(X_{ij}\\)s to be independent with a density \\(f(x_{ij};\\theta_{ij},\\phi)\\) from the exponential family of distributions. We identify \\(\\mu_{ij}=E[X_{ij}]\\) the expected value of cell \\(X_{ij}\\) \\(\\phi\\) the dispersion parameter and \\(\\text{Var}[X_{ij}]=\\phi \\cdot V(\\mu_{ij})\\), where \\(V(.)\\) is the variance function \\(\\eta_{ij}\\) the linear predictor such that \\(\\eta_{ij}=g(\\mu_{ij})\\) with \\(g\\) the link function. Distributions from the exponential family and their default link functions are listed on http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/family.html. We now discuss three specific GLMs widely used for loss reserving. First, the Poisson regression model was introduced in Section 8.2. In this model, we assume that \\(X_{ij}\\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\[ \\mu_{ij} = \\pi_i \\cdot \\gamma_j, \\] a cross-classified structure that captures a multiplicative effect of the occurrence year \\(i\\) and the development period \\(j\\). The proposed model structure is not identifiable without an additional constraint on the parameters, e.g. \\(\\sum_{j=0}^J \\gamma_j=1\\). This constraint gives an explicit interpretation to \\(\\pi_i\\) (with \\(i=1,\\ldots,I\\)) as the exposure or volume measure for occurrence year \\(i\\) and \\(\\gamma_j\\) as the fraction of the total volume paid out with delay \\(j\\). However, when calibrating GLMs in R alternative constraints such as \\(\\pi_1=1\\) or \\(\\gamma_1=1\\), or a reparametrization where \\(\\mu_{ij} = \\exp{(\\mu+\\alpha_i+\\beta_j)}\\) are easier to implement. We continue with the latter specification, including \\(\\alpha_1 = \\beta_0 = 0\\), the so-called corner constraints. This GLM treats the occurrence year and the payment delay as factor variables and fits a parameter per level, next to an intercept \\(\\mu\\). The corner constraints put the effect of the first level of a factor variable equal to zero. The Poisson assumption is particularly useful for a run-off triangle with numbers of reported claims, often used in the estimation of the number of IBNR Incurred in the past But is Not yet Reported. For such a claim the insured event took place, but the insurance company is not yet aware of the associated claim. claims (see Section 11.2). Second, an interesting modification of the basic Poisson regression model is the over-dispersed Poisson regression model where \\(Z_{ij}\\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\mu_{ij}/\\phi\\) and \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} X_{ij} &amp;\\sim \\phi \\cdot Z_{ij} \\\\ \\mu_{ij} &amp;= \\exp{(\\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j)}. \\end{array} \\] Consequently, \\(X_{ij}\\) has the same specification for the mean as in the basic Poisson regression model, but now \\[ \\text{Var}[X_{ij}] = \\phi^2 \\cdot \\text{Var}[Z_{ij}] = \\phi \\cdot \\exp{(\\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j)}. \\] This construction allows for under (when \\(\\phi &lt;1\\)) and over-dispersion (with \\(\\phi&gt;1\\)). Because \\(X_{ij}\\) no longer follows a well-known distribution, this approach is referred to as quasi-likelihood. It is particularly useful to model a run-off triangle with incremental payments, as these typically reveal over-dispersion. Third, the gamma regression model is relevant to model a run-off triangle with claim payments. Recall from Section 3.2.1 (see also the Appendix Chapter 18) with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\). From these, we reparameterize and define a new parameter \\(\\mu = \\alpha \\cdot \\theta\\) while retaining the scale parameter \\(\\theta\\). Further, assume that \\(X_{ij}\\) has a gamma distribution and allow \\(\\mu\\) to vary by \\(ij\\) such that \\[ \\mu_{ij} = \\exp{(\\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j)}. \\] 11.4.2 Model Estimation and Prediction We now estimate the regression parameters \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\alpha_i\\) and \\(\\beta_j\\) in the proposed GLMs. In R the glm function is readily available to estimate these parameters via maximum likelihood estimation (mleMaximum likelihood estimate) or quasi-likelihood estimation (in the case of the over-dispersed Poisson). Having the parameter estimates \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\), \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_i\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_j\\) available, a point estimate for each cell in the upper triangle follows \\[ \\hat{X}_{ij} =\\hat{E[X_{ij}]} = \\exp{(\\hat{\\mu}+\\hat{\\alpha}_i+\\hat{\\beta}_j)},\\ \\text{with}\\ i+j\\leq I. \\] Similarly, a cell in the lower triangle will be predicted as \\[ \\hat{X}_{ij} = \\hat{E[X_{ij}]} = \\exp{(\\hat{\\mu}+\\hat{\\alpha}_i+\\hat{\\beta}_j)},\\ \\text{with}\\ i+j&gt; I. \\] Point estimates for outstanding reserves (per occurrence year \\(i\\) or the total reserve) then follow by summing the cell-specific estimates. By combining the observations in the upper triangle with their point estimates, we can construct properly defined residuals and use these for residual inspection. 11.4.3 Bootstrap 11.5 Further Resources and Contributors Contributors Katrien Antonio, KU Leuven and University of Amsterdam, Jan Beirlant, KU Leuven, and Tim Veerdonck, University of Antwerp, are the principal authors of the initial version of this chapter.

It is here to give you a flavor of what will be in the final version. 12.1 Introduction Bonus-malus systemA type of rating mechanism where insured premiums are adjusted based on their individual loss experience history, which is used interchangeably as “no-fault discount”, “merit rating”, “experience rating” or “no-claim discount” in different countries, is based on penalizing insureds who are responsible for one or more claims by a premium surcharge, and awarding insureds with a premium discount if they do not have any claims. Insurers use bonus-malus systems for two main purposes; to encourage drivers to drive more carefully in a year without any claims, and to ensure insureds to pay premiums proportional to their risks based on their claims experience. No Claim Discount (NCD) systemA type of experience rating where insureds obtain discounts on future years’ premiums based on claims-free experience is an experience rating system commonly used in motor insurance. It represents an attempt to categorize insureds into homogeneous groups who pay premiums based on their claims experience. Depending on the rules in the scheme, new policyholders may be required to pay full premium initially, and obtain discounts in the future years as a results of claim-free years. An NCD system rewards policyholders for not making any claims during a year, or in other words, it grants a bonus to a careful driver. This bonus principle may affect policy holders’ decisions whether to claim or not to claim, especially when involving accidents with slight damages, which is known as ‘hunger for bonusPhenomenon where insureds under an experience rating system are dissuaded from filing minor claims in order to keep their no-claims discount’ phenomenon. The option of ‘hunger for bonus’ under an NCD system may reduce insurers’ claim costs, and may be able to offset the expected decrease in premium income. 12.2 NCD System in Several Countries 12.2.1 NCD System in Malaysia Before the liberalization of Motor Tariff on 1st July 2017, the rating of motor insurance in Malaysia was governed by Motor Tariff. Under the tariff, the rate charged should not be lower than the rates specified under the classes of risks, to ensure that the price competition among insurers will not go below the country’s economic level. The basic rating factors considered were scope of insurance, cubic capacity of vehicle and estimated value of vehicle (or sum insured, whichever is lower). Under the Motor Tariff, the final premium to be paid is adjusted by the policyholder’s claim experience, or equivalently, his NCD entitlement. Effective on 1st July 2017, the premium rates for motor insurance are liberalized, or de-tariffed. The pricing of premium is now determined by individual insurers and takafulCo-operative system of reimbursement or repayment in case of loss as an insurance alternative operators, and the consumers are able to enjoy a wider choice of motor insurance products at competitive prices. Since tariff liberalization encourages innovation and competition among insurers and takaful operators, the premiums are based on broader risk factors other than the two rating factors specified in the Motor Tariff, i.e. sum insured and cubic capacity of vehicle. Other rating factors may be defined in the risk profile of an insured, such as age of vehicle, age of driver, safety and security features of vehicle, geographical location of vehicle and traffic offences of driver. As different insurers and takaful operators have different ways of defining the risk profile of an insured, the price of a policy may differ from one insurer to another. However, the NCD structure from the Motor Tariff remains ‘unchanged’ and continue to exist, and is ‘transferable’ from one insurer, or from one takaful operator, to another. The discounts in the Malaysian NCD system are divided into six classes, starting from the initial class of 0% discount, followed by classes of 25%, 30%, 38.3%, 45% and 55% discounts. Table 1 provides the classes of NCD system in Malaysia. A claim-free year indicates that a policyholder is entitled to move one-step forward to the next discount class, such as from a 0% discount to a 25% discount in the renewal year. If a policyholder is already at the highest class, which is at a 55% discount, a claim-free year indicates that the policyholder remains in the same class. On the other hand, if one or more claims are made within the year, the NCD will be forfeited and the policyholder has to start at 0% discount in the renewal year. In other words, the policyholder has to pay a full premium for the next year’s renewal premium, regardless of his current class of NCD. For an illustration purpose, Figure 12.1 shows the transition diagram for the NCD classes under the Malaysian Motor Tariff. The transition starts at class 0, and increase one by one if an insured has a no-claim year. If an insured has one or more claims within the year, the current class automatically returns to class 0. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 1: Classes of NCD (Malaysia)}\\\\ \\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\hline \\text{Classes (claim-free years)} &amp; \\text{Discounts}\\\\ \\hline\\\\ {0} &amp; {0}\\\\ {1} &amp; {25}\\\\ {2} &amp; {30}\\\\ {3} &amp; {38.33}\\\\ {4} &amp; {45}\\\\ {5\\text{ and above}} &amp; {55}\\\\\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Figure 12.1: Transition diagram for NCD classes (Malaysia) 12.2.2 NCD System in Other Countries The NCD system in Brazil are subdivided into seven classes, with the following premium levels (Lemaire 1998): 100, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, and 65. These premium levels are also equivalent to the following discount classes: 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 45%. New policyholders have to start at 0% discount, or at level 100, and a claim-free year indicates that a policyholder can move forward at a one-class discount. If one or more claims incurred within the year, the policyholder has to move backward, also at a one-class discount. Table 2 and Figure 12.2 respectively show the classes and the transition diagram for the NCD system in Brazil. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 2: Classes of NCD (Brazil)}\\\\ \\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\hline \\text{Classes (claim-free years)} &amp; \\text{Discounts}\\\\ \\hline\\\\ {0} &amp; {0}\\\\ {1} &amp; {10}\\\\ {2} &amp; {15}\\\\ {3} &amp; {20}\\\\ {4} &amp; {25}\\\\ {5} &amp; {30}\\\\ {6\\text{ and above}} &amp; {45}\\\\\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Figure 12.2: Transition diagram for NCD classes (Brazil) The NCD system in Switzerland, which is implemented in 1990, are subdivided into twenty-two classes, with the following premium levels: 270, 250, 230, 215, 200, 185, 170, 155, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50 and 45 (Lemaire and Zi 1994). These levels are also equivalent to the following loadings: 170%, 150%, 130%, 115%, 100%, 85%, 70%, 55%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, and the following discounts: 0%, 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50% and 55%. New policyholders have to start at 170% loading, or at 270 premium level, and a claim-free year indicates that a policyholder can move one-class forward. If one or more claims incurred within the year, the policyholder has to move four-classes backwards.

Under this model, the state space consists of classes of bonus-malus, and the state (or class) is assumed to shift randomly from year to year. Therefore, it is important to know a brief description on two elements; a stochastic process that has a Markov property, and a discrete time Markov chain. Definition: A stochastic process has a Markov property if the probability distribution of future states, conditional on both past and present states, depends only upon the present state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. Definition: A discrete time Markov chain is a stochastic process that can be parameterized by empirically estimating the transition probabilities between discrete states. 12.3.1 Transition Probability The randomness of the transition of the NCD classes is governed by the transition probability in a given year. The definition of a transition probability is provided here to understand the use of the probability for representing the transition of the NCD classes. Definition: The transition probability from state \\(i\\) (at time \\(n\\)) to state \\(j\\) (at time \\(n + 1\\)) is called a one-step transition probability, and is denoted by \\(p_{ij} = Pr (X_{n + 1} = j|X_n = i)\\), \\(i = 1,2,...,k\\), \\(j = 1,2,...,k\\). The transition probabilities can be represented by a \\(k \\times k\\) matrix. Assuming a homogeneous Markov process, a k-state Markov chain can be represented by a matrix of transition probabilities \\({\\bf P}\\): \\[ {\\bf P} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} p_{11} &amp; p_{12} &amp; \\ldots &amp; &amp; &amp; p_{1k} \\\\ p_{21} &amp; p_{22} &amp; \\ldots &amp; &amp; &amp; p_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ p_{k1} &amp; p_{k2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; &amp; &amp; p_{kk} \\end{array} } \\right]. \\] Each row of the transition matrixMatrix that represents all probabilities for transition from one state to another (could be same state) for a markov chain represents the transition of flowing out of state, whereas each column represents the transition of flowing into the state. The cumulative transitions of flowing out of state must equal 1, or each row of the matrix must sum to 1, i.e. \\(\\sum\\limits_j p_{ij} = 1\\). All probabilities must also be non-negative (since they are probabilities), i.e. \\(p_{ij} \\ge 0\\). Consider the Malaysian NCD system. Under this system, let the random variable \\(X_t\\) denotes the class of NCD at time \\(t\\) and takes the values in a state space \\(\\bf{S}\\), where \\({\\bf S} = \\{0,1,...,5\\}\\). Therefore, the probability of a no-claim year is equal to the probability of transition from state \\(i\\) to state \\(j\\), which is \\(p_{ij}\\), \\(i = 0,1,2,...,5\\), \\(j = 0,1,2,...,5\\). If an insured has one or more claims within the year, the probability of transitioning back to state 0 is represented by \\(p_{i0}\\), which is also equivalent to \\(1 - {p_{ij}}.\\) Therefore, there are only two transition probabilities in each row; the probability of advancing to the next state, \\(p_{ij},\\) and the probability of returning back to state zero, \\(p_{i0} = 1 - p_{ij}\\). In terms of transition probabilities, the Malaysian NCD system can be represented by the following \\((6 \\times 6)\\) transition matrix: \\[ {\\bf P} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} p_{00}&amp;p_{01}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ p_{10}&amp;0&amp;p_{12}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ p_{20}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{23}&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ p_{30}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{34}&amp;0\\\\ p_{40}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{45}\\\\ p_{50}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{55} \\end{array} }\\right] = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {1 - p_{01}}&amp;p_{01}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ {1 - p_{12}}&amp;0&amp;p_{12}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ {1 - p_{23}}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{23}&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ {1 - p_{34}}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{34}&amp;0\\\\ {1 - p_{45}}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{45}\\\\ {1 - p_{55}}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;p_{55} \\end{array} }\\right] \\] Example 1 Provide the transition matrix for the NCD system in Brazil. Solution Based on the NCD classes and the transition diagram shown respectively in Table 2 and Figure 12.2, the probability of a no-claim year is equal to the probability of moving one-class forward, whereas the probability of having one or more claims within the year is equal to the probability of moving one-class backward. Therefore, each row can contain two or more transition probabilities; one probability for advancing to the next state, and one or more probabilities for moving one-class backwards. The transition matrix is: \\[ {\\bf P} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {1 - p_{01}}&amp;p_{01}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ {1 - p_{12}}&amp;0&amp;p_{12}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ {1 - \\sum\\limits_j p_{2j}}&amp;p_{21}&amp;0&amp;p_{23}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ {1 - \\sum\\limits_j p_{3j}}&amp;p_{31}&amp;p_{32}&amp;0&amp;p_{34}&amp;0&amp;0\\\\\\ {1 - \\sum\\limits_j p_{4j}}&amp;p_{41}&amp;p_{42}&amp;p_{43}&amp;0&amp;p_{45}&amp;0\\\\ {1 - \\sum\\limits_j p_{5j}}&amp;p_{51}&amp;p_{52}&amp;p_{53}&amp;p_{54}&amp;0&amp;p_{56}\\\\ {1 - \\sum\\limits_j p_{6j}}&amp;p_{61}&amp;p_{62}&amp;p_{63}&amp;p_{64}&amp;p_{65}&amp;p_{66} \\end{array} } \\right] \\] Example 2 Provide the transition matrix for the NCD system in Switzerland.

If we are interested in the distribution of the transition in the long run (which may take several years), the stationary probability can be used. Several definitions and properties are provided here to understand the use of a Markov chain model for representing the stationary distribution of the NCD transitions. However, students are encouraged to refer to textbooks on Markov Chain and stochastic processes available in the literature for a more comprehensive knowledge on the related subjects. Definition: A Markov chain is said to be irreducible if it is possible to move to any state from any other state. Definition: A state \\(i\\) has period \\(k\\) if any return to state \\(i\\) must occur in multiples of \\(k\\) time steps. If \\(k = 1\\), then the state is said to be aperiodic. Definition: A state \\(i\\) is said to be transient if, given that we start in state \\(i\\), there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to \\(i\\). State \\(i\\) is recurrent (or persistent) if it is not transient. A state \\(i\\) is positive recurrent if the mean recurrent time (or expected return time) is finite. Definition: A state \\(i\\) is said to be ergodic if it is aperiodic and positive recurrent. In other words, a state \\(i\\) is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of one (aperiodic), and has finite mean recurrence time. If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic. Definition: Let \\(p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr ({X_n} = j\\|{X_0} = i)\\) be the probability of transition from state \\(i\\) to state \\(j\\) in \\(n\\) time steps. The n-step transition probabilities for a stationary Markov chain satisfy the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation: \\[p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\sum\\limits_r {p_{ir}^{(k)}p_{rj}^{(n - k)}}\\] for any \\(k\\), where \\(0 &lt; k &lt; n\\). Definition: If a Markov chain is stationary, then the vector \\({\\bf{\\pi }}\\) is called a stationary distributionProbability distribution remains unchanged in the markov chain as time progresses (or invariant measure) if it satisfies: \\[0 \\le {\\pi _j} \\le 1\\] \\[\\sum\\limits_j {{\\pi _j}} = 1,\\] \\[{\\pi_j} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi_i}p_{ij}\\]. In terms of vectors and matrices, a stationary distribution \\({\\bf{\\pi }}\\) is a row vector, whose entries are non-negative and sum to one, that is unchanged by the operation: \\({\\bf{\\pi P}} = {\\bf{\\pi }}\\). If a Markov chain is stationary, then the transition matrix \\({\\bf{P}}\\) is the same after each step, so that the \\(k\\)-step transition probability can be computed as the \\(k\\)-th power of the transition matrix, \\({{\\bf{P}}^k}.\\) From the definitions and properties above, a BMS forms a regular Markov chain if all of its states (NCD classes) are ergodicIrreducible markov chain where it is eventually possible to move from any state to any other state, with positive probability, and the chain is not cyclic (or irreversibleA markov chain where there does not exist a probability distribution that allows for the chain to be walked backwards in time). The row vector, \\({\\bf{\\pi }}\\), which is also the left eigenvectorA non-zero vector that changes by only a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied of the transition matrix, is a stationary distribution defined by \\(0 \\le {\\pi _j} \\le 1\\) and \\(\\sum\\limits_j {{\\pi_j}} = 1\\). Example 3 Find the stationary distribution for the NCD system in Malaysia assuming that the probability of a no-claim year for all NCD classes are \\({p_0}\\). Solution The transition matrix can be re-written as: The stationary distribution can be calculated using \\({\\pi _j} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi _i}p_{ij}\\). The solutions are: \\[ \\begin{array}{l} {\\pi _0} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi_i}p_{i0} = (1 - {p_0})\\sum\\limits_i {{\\pi _i}} = 1 - {p_0}\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _1} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi _i}p_{i1} = {\\pi_0}{p_{01}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _2} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi _i}p_{i2} = {\\pi _1}{p_{12}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^2\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _3} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi _i}p_{i3} = {\\pi _2}{p_{23}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^3\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _4} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi _i}p_{i4} = {\\pi _3}{p_{34}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^4\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _5} = \\sum\\limits_i {\\pi _i}p_{i5} = {\\pi _4}{p_{45}} + {\\pi _5}{p_{55}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^5 + {\\pi _5}{p_0}\\\\\\\\ \\therefore {\\pi _5} = \\frac{(1 - {p_0}){p_0}^5}{{(1 - {p_0})}} = {p_0}^5 \\end{array} \\] The stationary distribution (or steady state condition) shown in Example 3 represents the asymptotic distribution of the NCD system, or the distribution in the long run. As an example, assuming that the probability of a no-claim year is \\(p_0 = 0.90,\\) the stationary probabilities are: \\[ \\begin{array}{l} {\\pi _0} = 1 - {p_0} = 0.1000\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _1} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0} = 0.0900\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _2} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^2 = 0.0810\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _3} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^3 = 0.0729\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _4} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^4 = 0.0656\\\\\\\\ {\\pi _5} = {p_0}^5 = 0.5905 \\end{array} \\] In other words, \\({\\pi_0} = 0.10\\) indicates that 10% of insureds will eventually belong to class 0 (or zero claim-free years), \\({\\pi _1} = 0.09\\) indicates that 9% of insureds will eventually belong to class 1 (or one claim-free year), and so forth, until \\({\\pi _5} = 0.59\\), which indicates that 59% of insureds will eventually belong to class 5 (or five successive claim-free years). 12.4.2 R Program for Stationary Distribution We can use the left eigenvector of a transition matrix to calculate the stationary distribution.

Under the NCD system, the n-step transition probabilityProbability of ending in a state j after n periods, starting in state i, where i and j can be the same state, \\(p_{ij}^{(n)}\\), can be used to observe the evolution of the mean premium. A definition on n-step transition probabaility \\(p_{ij}^{(n)}\\) is provided here to understand the use of the probability for observing the evolution of the mean premium.

Examples 8-9 provide the degree of convergence for two different BMS (two different countries). The Malaysian BMS reaches full stationary only after four years, while the BMS in Brazil takes a longer period. As mentioned in Lemaire (1998), a more sophisticated BMS would converge more slowly, and is considered as a drawback as it takes a longer period to stabilize. The main objective of a BMS is to separate the good drivers from the bad drivers, and thus, it is desirable to have a classification process that can be finalized (or stabilized) as soon as possible. 12.5 BMS and Premium Rating 12.5.1 Premium Rating Premium rating is the process of establishing premium rates in an insurance system, or other risk transfer mechanisms. The process involves a number of considerations such as statistical methods, marketing goals, competition and legal restrictions. Premium rating should fulfill four basic objectives generally agreed among the actuaries; producing ‘fair’ premium rates whereby high risks insureds pay higher premium and vice versa, providing sufficient funds for paying incurred losses and expenses, providing adequate margin for adverse deviation, and producing reasonable returns to insurers. Before we discuss the application of BMS in premium rating, a brief discussion of the Poisson and negative binomial regression models are provided here. The Poisson regression has been widely used for fitting count (or frequency) data in insurance area. The negative binomial regression model can be used for fitting count (or frequency) data with overdispersionPhenomenon where the variance of data is larger than what is modeled, which is a situation when the variance is larger than the mean. However, students are encouraged to refer to textbooks on GLMGeneralized linear models or regression models available in the literature for a more comprehensive knowledge on the related subjects. 12.5.2 Frequency Model – Poisson and Negative Binomial Regressions Let \\({({Y_1},{Y_2},...,{Y_n})^T}\\) be the vector of count random variables and \\(n\\) be the sample size. The probability mass function (p.m.f.) for Poisson regression modelType of regression model used for fitting data with an integral (count) response variable with mean equal to the variance is, \\[\\Pr ({Y_i} = {y_i}) \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} = \\frac{{{\\exp(- {\\mu _i})}{\\mu _i}^{y_i}}}{y_i{!}}&amp;{y_i = 0,1,...} \\end{array} \\] with mean and variance \\(E({Y_i}) = Var({Y_i}) = {\\mu _i}\\). To take into account non-negative values, the mean, or the fitted value, is assumed to follow a log link, \\(E({Y_i}) = {\\mu _i} = \\exp ({\\bf x}_{\\bf i}{\\bf &#39;\\beta })\\), where \\({\\bf{x}}_{\\bf i}\\) denotes the vector of explanatory variables and \\({\\bf \\beta}\\) is the vector of regression parameters. The maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained by maximizing the log likelihood. The p.m.f. for negative binomial regression modelType of regression model used for fitting data with an integral (count) response variable and can account for variance greater than the mean is, \\[ \\Pr ({Y_i} = {y_i}) = \\frac{{\\Gamma ({y_i} + v)}}{y_i{!}\\Gamma (v)} \\left( \\frac{v}{v + {\\mu _i}} \\right)^v \\left( \\frac{\\mu _i}{v + {\\mu _i}} \\right)^{y_i},{y_i} = 0,1,2,..., \\] where the mean is \\(E({Y_i}) = {\\mu _i}\\), the variance is \\(Var({Y_i}) = {\\mu _i}(1 + {v^{ - 1}}{\\mu _i}) = {\\mu _i}(1 + a{\\mu _i})\\), and \\({v^{ - 1}} = a\\) denotes the dispersion parameter. The NB regression model reduce to the Poisson regression model in the limit as \\(a \\to 0\\), and display overdispersion when \\(a &gt; 0\\). The mean can also be assumed to follow the log link, \\(E({Y_i}) = {\\mu _i} = \\exp ({{\\bf x}_{\\bf i}{\\bf{&#39;\\beta }}})\\), and the maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained by maximizing the log likelihood. 12.5.3 Premium Rating with Bonus-Malus Data Under this section, we will consider the statistical approach of obtaining premium rates using count data (frequency data) that provides bonus-malus information on the risk profiles of the insureds. Example 10 Consider the Canadian private automobile liability insurance data from Bailey and Simon (1960). The data provides information on the number of claims incurred and exposures (expressed in terms of number of earned car years). The data is classified into two rating factors; merit rating and class rating. Altogether, there are twenty \\((4 \\times 5)\\) cross-classified rating classesTable that combines the effects of multiple rating classifications of claim frequencies (20 count data). Table 5 provides the description of the two rating factors. It can be seen that merit rating provides information on the number of accident-free years, and thus, the information can be used as bonus-malus information. Using the Canadian automobile insurance data: Fit the count data using Poisson regression model. Calculate the premium assuming that the claim severity is 1000 for all rating classes. Build a simple premium table, and suggest the percentage of discounts (or loadings) for the premiums if the BMS is to be considered. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 5: Rating factors (Canadian data)}\\\\ \\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\hline \\text{Merit} &amp; \\text{Class}\\\\ \\hline\\\\ \\text{A = licensed, accident-free ≥ 3 years } &amp; \\text{1 = pleasure, no male operator &lt; 25 } \\\\ \\text{X = licensed, accident-free 2 years } &amp; \\text{2 = pleasure, non-principal male operator &lt; 25 } \\\\ \\text{Y = licensed, accident-free 1 year } &amp; \\text{3 = business use } \\\\ \\text{B = others} &amp; \\text{4 = unmarried owner / principal operator &lt; 25} \\\\ &amp; \\text{5 = married owner / principal operator &lt; 25 } \\\\\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Solution Table 6 provides the parameter estimates (and standard errors) for the Poisson regression model which is fitted to the count data. The premiums are calculated by multiplying the fitted frequencies with the claim severities. The fitted frequency is obtained by dividing the fitted count with the exposure. The fitted count, \\(E({Y_i}) = {\\mu _i} = {\\hat y_i}\\), is the fitted value obtained from the Poisson regression model. The premiums for all rating classes, are shown in Table 7. Let the premium classified under merit B be the base premium. The premium relativities and the percentage of discounts for each rating class can be calculated, and the values are shown in Table 8. A simple premium table, which provides the percentage of discounts based on the number of accident-free years, can be constructed and is shown in Table 9. The discounts can be suggested for implementing the BMS. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 6: Poisson regression model (Canadian data)}\\\\ \\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\hline \\text{Regression parameter} &amp;

Example 11 The dataset for private car Own Damage (OD) claim count in Malaysia (Zamani and Ismail 2012, Ismail and Zamani 2013) is considered here. The data is based on 1.01 million private car policies for a three-year period of 2001-2003. The exposures are expressed in car-year units. Table 10 shows the rating factors for the claim count data. Altogether, there are \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625\\) cross-classified rating classes of claim frequencies (625 count data). However, the number of rating classes (sample size) reduces to 547 after excluding count data with zero exposure. It can be seen from the description in Table 10 that the data does not provide information on the number of claim-free years (bonus-malus information). Using the Malaysian private car insurance data: Fit the count data using Poisson and negative binomial regression models. Compare both models and suggest a preferred model for the data. Calculate the premium assuming that the claim severity is MYR 1000 (Ringgit Malaysia) for all rating classes. Build a premium table, assuming that the NCD is to be implemented. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 10: Rating factors (Malaysian data)}\\\\ \\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\hline \\text{Rating factors} &amp; \\text{Description} \\\\ \\hline\\\\ \\text{Vehicle age} &amp; \\text{0-1 year } \\\\ &amp; \\text{2-3 years} \\\\ &amp; \\text{4-5 years} \\\\ &amp; \\text{6-7 years} \\\\ &amp; \\text{8+ years} \\\\ \\text{Vehicle c.c.} &amp; \\text{0-1000} \\\\ &amp; \\text{1001-1300} \\\\ &amp; \\text{1301-1500} \\\\ &amp; \\text{1501-1800} \\\\ &amp; \\text{1801+} \\\\ \\text{Vehicle make} &amp; \\text{Local type 1} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Local type 2} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Foreign type 1} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Foreign type 2} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Foreign type 3} \\\\ \\text{Location} &amp; \\text{North} \\\\ &amp; \\text{East} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Central} \\\\ &amp; \\text{South} \\\\ &amp; \\text{East Malaysia} \\\\\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Solution Table 11 shows the parameter estimates (and standard errors) for the fitted Poisson and negative binomial regression models. The results indicate that the regression parameters of all models have similar estimates. The likelihood ratio for testing overdispersion between the Poisson and the NB models is 2844.14, indicating that the data is overdispersed and the NB is a better model. The AICAkaike’s information criterion and BICBayesian information criterion also indicate that the NB is a better model. Table 12 shows the parameter estimates (and standard errors) for the fitted negative binomial regression model with significant covariates (covariates with \\(p\\)-values larger than 0.10 are excluded). The NB model in Table 12 is suggested as the preferred model for the data. The premiums are calculated by multiplying the fitted frequencies with the claim severities. The premiums for the first 25 rating classes (vehicle age: 0-1 year and vehicle make: local-type 1) are shown in Table 13. The Malaysian NCD system have six discount classes (0%, 25%, 30%, 38.3%, 45% and 55%) for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+ claim-free years. The final premium rates should be ‘inflated’ accordingly to take into account the NCD (discount entitlement) of each insured. We can use the stationary distribution to approximate the proportion of insureds in each NCD class (in the long run). Assume that the probability of a no-claim year for all NCD classes is 0.90. The stationary probabilities are (from Example 3): \\[ {\\pi_0} = 0.1000,\\rm{ }{\\pi _1} = 0.0900,\\rm{ }{\\pi _2} = 0.0810,\\rm{ }{\\pi _3} = 0.0729,\\rm{ }{\\pi _4} = 0.0656,\\rm{ }{\\pi _5} = 0.5905 \\] which indicates that 10% of insureds eventually belong to class 0 (zero claim-free years), 9% of insureds eventually belong to class 1 (one claim-free year), and so forth, until 59% of insureds eventually belong to class 5 (or five successive claim-free years). After implementing the NCD, the premium (in the long run) will be reduced (on average) by the following factor: \\[ \\begin{array}{l} = \\sum\\limits_j \\text{(proportion of insureds in class }j)\\text{(1 - NCD in class }j) \\\\\\\\ = (0.1000)(1) + (0.0900)(1 - 0.25) + ... + (0.5905)(1 - 0.55)\\\\\\\\ = {0}{.570962} \\end{array} \\] Therefore, the final premiums (after adjusting for the NCD) should be inflated by \\(1 \\div 0.57 = 1.75\\). A premium table can be constructed based on the factor (1.75). The final premiums for the first 5 rating classes are shown in Table 14, and can be suggested for implementing the NCD. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Table 11: Poisson and negative binomial regression models (Malaysian data)}\\\\ \\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\hline \\text{Parameters} &amp;

This chapter covers the learning areas on data and systems outlined in the IAA (International Actuarial Association) Education Syllabus published in September 2015. This chapter is organized into three major parts: data, data analysis, and data analysis techniques. The first part introduces data basics such as data types, data structures, data storages, and data sources. The second part discusses the process and various aspects of data analysis. The third part presents some commonly used techniques for data analysis. 13.1 Data 13.1.1 Data Types and Sources In terms of how data are collected, data can be divided into two types (Hox and Boeije 2005): primary data and secondary data. Primary data are original data that are collected for a specific research problem. Secondary data are data originally collected for a different purpose and reused for another research problem. A major advantage of using primary data is that the theoretical constructs, the research design, and the data collection strategy can be tailored to the underlying research question to ensure that the data collected indeed help to solve the problem. A disadvantage of using primary data is that data collection can be costly and time-consuming. Using secondary data has the advantage of lower cost and faster access to relevant information. However, using secondary data may not be optimal for the research question under consideration. In terms of the degree of organization of the data, data can be also divided into two types (Inmon and Linstedt 2014; O’Leary 2013; Hashem et al. 2015; Abdullah and Ahmad 2013; Pries and Dunnigan 2015): structured data and unstructured data. Structured dataData that can be organized into a repository format, typically a database have a predictable and regularly occurring format. In contrast, unstructured dataData that is not in a predefined format, most notably text, audio visual are unpredictable and have no structure that is recognizable to a computer. Structured data consist of records, attributes, keys, and indices and are typically managed by a database management system (DBMS) such as IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. As a result, most units of structured data can be located quickly and easily. Unstructured data have many different forms and variations. One common form of unstructured data is text. Accessing unstructured data is clumsy. To find a given unit of data in a long text, for example, sequentially search is usually performed. In terms of how the data are measured, data can be classified as qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative dataData which is non numerical in nature are data about qualities, which cannot be actually measured. As a result, qualitative data are extremely varied in nature and include interviews, documents, and artifacts (Miles, Hberman, and Sdana 2014). Quantitative dataData which is numerical in nature are data about quantities, which can be measured numerically with numbers. In terms of the level of measurement, quantitative data can be further classified as nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio (Gan 2011). Nominal data, also called categorical data, are discrete data without a natural ordering. Ordinal dataData field with a natural ordering are discrete data with a natural order. Interval dataContinuous data which is broken into interval bands with a natural ordering are continuous data with a specific order and equal intervals. Ratio data are interval data with a natural zero. There exist a number of data sources. First, data can be obtained from university-based researchers who collect primary data. Second, data can be obtained from organizations that are set up for the purpose of releasing secondary data for general research community. Third, data can be obtained from national and regional statistical institutes that collect data. Finally, companies have corporate data that can be obtained for research purpose. While it might be difficult to obtain data to address a specific research problem or answer a business question, it is relatively easy to obtain data to test a model or an algorithm for data analysis. In the modern era, readers can obtain datasets from the Internet easily. The following is a list of some websites to obtain real-world data: UCI Machine Learning Repository This website (url: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) maintains more than 400 datasets that can be used to test machine learning algorithms. Kaggle The Kaggle website (url: https://www.kaggle.com/) include real-world datasets used for data science competition. Readers can download data from Kaggle by registering an account. DrivenData DrivenData aims at bringing cutting-edge practices in data science to solve some of the world’s biggest social challenges. In its website (url: https://www.drivendata.org/), readers can participate data science competitions and download datasets. Analytics Vidhya This website (url: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/) allows you to participate and download datasets from practice problems and hackathon problems. KDD Cup KDD Cup is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. This website (url: http://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup) contains the datasets used in past KDD Cup competitions since 1997. U.S. Government’s open data This website (url: https://www.data.gov/) contains about 200,000 datasets covering a wide range of areas including climate, education, energy, and finance. AWS Public Datasets In this website (url: https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/), Amazon provides a centralized repository of public datasets, including some huge datasets. 13.1.2 Data Structures and Storage As mentioned in the previous subsection, there are structured data as well as unstructured data. Structured data are highly organized data and usually have the following tabular format: \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{lllll} \\hline &amp; V_1 &amp; V_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; V_d \\ \\\\\\hline \\textbf{x}_1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1d} \\\\ \\textbf{x}_2 &amp; x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2d} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\textbf{x}_n &amp; x_{n1} &amp; x_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{nd} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] In other words, structured data can be organized into a table consists of rows and columns. Typically, each row represents a record and each column represents an attribute. A table can be decomposed into several tables that can be stored in a relational database such as the Microsoft SQL Server. The SQL (Structured Query Language) can be used to access and modify the data easily and efficiently. Unstructured data do not follow a regular format (Abdullah and Ahmad 2013). Examples of unstructured data include documents, videos, and audio files. Most of the data we encounter are unstructured data. In fact, the term ``big data’’ was coined to reflect this fact. Traditional relational databases cannot meet the challenges on the varieties and scales brought by massive unstructured data nowadays. NoSQL databases have been used to store massive unstructured data. There are three main NoSQL databases (Chen et al. 2014): key-value databases, column-oriented databases, and document-oriented databases. Key-value databasesData storage method that stores amd finds records using a unique key hash use a simple data model and store data according to key-values. Modern key-value databases have higher expandability and smaller query response time than relational databases. Examples of key-value databases include Dynamo used by Amazon and Voldemort used by LinkedIn. Column-oriented databasesData storage method that stores records by column instead of by row store and process data according to columns rather than rows. The columns and rows are segmented in multiple nodes to achieve expandability. Examples of column-oriented databases include BigTable developed by Google and Cassandra developed by FaceBook. Document databasesData storage method that uses the document metadata for search and retrieval, also known as semi-structured data are designed to support more complex data forms than those stored in key-value databases. Examples of document databases include MongoDB, SimpleDB, and CouchDB. MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that stores documents as binary objects. SimpleDB is a distributed NoSQL database used by Amazon. CouchDB is another open-source document-oriented database. 13.1.3 Data Quality Accurate data are essential to useful data analysis. The lack of accurate data may lead to significant costs to organizations in areas such as correction activities, lost customers, missed opportunities, and incorrect decisions (Olson 2003). Data has quality if it satisfies its intended use, that is, the data is accurate, timely, relevant, complete, understood, and trusted (Olson 2003). As a result, we first need to know the specification of the intended uses and then judge the suitability for those uses in order to assess the quality of the data. Unintended uses of data can arise from a variety of reasons and lead to serious problems. Accuracy is the single most important component of high-quality data. Accurate data have the following properties (Olson 2003): The data elements are not missing and have valid values. The values of the data elements are in the right ranges and have the right representations. Inaccurate data arise from different sources. In particular, the following areas are common areas where inaccurate data occur: Initial data entry. Mistakes (including deliberate errors) and system errors can occur during the initial data entry. Flawed data entry processes can result in inaccurate data. Data decay. Data decayCorruption of data due to hardware failure in the storage device, also known as data degradation, refers to the gradual corruption of computer data due to an accumulation of non-critical failures in a storage device. Data moving and restructuring. Inaccurate data can also arise from data extracting, cleaning, transforming, loading, or integrating. Data using. Faulty reporting and lack of understanding can lead to inaccurate data. ReverificationManual process of checking the integrity of data and analysis are two approaches to find inaccurate data elements. The first approach is done by people, who manually check every data element by going back to the original source of the data. The second approach is done by software with the skills of an analyst to search through data to find possible inaccurate data elements. To ensure that the data elements are 100% accurate, we must use reverification. However, reverification can be time-consuming and may not be possible for some data. Analytical techniques can also be used to identify inaccurate data elements. There are five types of analysis that can be used to identify inaccurate data (Olson 2003): data element analysisAnalysis of the format and definition of each field, structural analysisStatistical analysis of the structured data present to detect irregularities, value correlation, aggregation correlation, and value inspection Companies can create a data quality assurance program to create high-quality databases. For more information about management of data quality issues and data profiling techniques, readers are referred to Olson (2003). 13.1.4 Data Cleaning Raw data usually need to be cleaned before useful analysis can be conducted. In particular, the following areas need attention when preparing data for analysis (Janert 2010): Missing values It is common to have missing values in raw data. Depending on the situations, we can discard the record, discard the variable, or impute the missing values. Outliers Raw data may contain unusual data points such as outliers. We need to handle outliers carefully. We cannot just remove outliers without knowing the reason for their existence. Sometimes the outliers are caused by clerical errors. Sometimes outliers are the effect we are looking for. Junk Raw data may contain junks such as nonprintable characters. Junks are typically rare and not easy to get noticed. However, junks can cause serious problems in downstream applications. Format Raw data may be formatted in a way that is inconvenient for subsequent analysis. For example, components of a record may be split into multiple lines in a text file. In such cases, lines corresponding to a single record should be merged before loading to a data analysis software such as R. Duplicate records Raw data may contain duplicate records. Duplicate records should be recognized and removed. This task may not be trivial depending on what you consider ``duplicate.’’ Merging datasets Raw data may come from different sources. In such cases, we need to merge the data from different sources to ensure compatibility. For more information about how to handle data in R, readers are referred to Forte (2015) and Buttrey and Whitaker (2017). Show Quiz Solution 13.2 Data Analysis Preliminaries Data analysis involves inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information to suggest conclusions and make decisions. Data analysis has a long history. In 1962, statistician John Tukey defined data analysis as: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data. — (Tukey 1962) Recently, Judd and coauthors defined data analysis as the following equation(Judd, McClelland, and Ryan 2017): \\[\\hbox{Data} = \\hbox{Model} + \\hbox{Error},\\] where Data represents a set of basic scores or observations to be analyzed, Model is a compact representation of the data, and Error is simply the amount the model fails to represent accurately. Using the above equation for data analysis, an analyst must resolve the following two conflicting goals: to add more parameters to the model so that the model represents the data better. to remove parameters from the model so that the model is simple and parsimonious. In this section, we give a high-level introduction to data analysis, including different types of methods. 13.2.1 Data Analysis Process Data analysis is part of an overall study. For example, Figure 13.1 shows the process of a typical study in behavioral and social sciences as described in Albers (2017). The data analysis part consists of the following steps: Exploratory analysis The purpose of this step is to get a feel of the relationships with the data and figure out what type of analysis for the data makes sense. Statistical analysis This step performs statistical analysis such as determining statistical significance and effect size. Make sense of the results This step interprets the statistical results in the context of the overall study. Determine implications This step interprets the data by connecting it to the study goals and the larger field of this study. The goal of the data analysis as described above focuses on explaining some phenomenon (See Section 13.2.5). Figure 13.1: The process of a typical study in behavioral and social sciences. Shmueli (2010) described a general process for statistical modeling, which is shown in Figure 13.2. Depending on the goal of the analysis, the steps differ in terms of the choice of methods, criteria, data, and information. Figure 13.2: The process of statistical modeling. 13.2.2 Exploratory versus Confirmatory There are two phases of data analysis (Good 1983): exploratory data analysisApproach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, using visual methods, descriptive statistics, clustering, dimension reduction (EDA) and confirmatory data analysisProcess used to challenge assumptions about the data through hypothesis tests, significance testing, model estimation, prediction, confidence intervals, and inference (CDA). Table 13.1 summarizes some differences between EDA and CDA. EDA is usually applied to observational data with the goal of looking for patterns and formulating hypotheses. In contrast, CDA is often applied to experimental data (i.e., data obtained by means of a formal design of experiments) with the goal of quantifying the extent to which discrepancies between the model and the data could be expected to occur by chance (Gelman 2004). \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{lll} \\hline &amp; \\textbf{EDA} &amp; \\textbf{CDA} \\\\\\hline \\text{Data} &amp; \\text{Observational data} &amp; \\text{Experimental data}\\\\[3mm] \\text{Goal} &amp; \\text{Pattern recognition,} &amp; \\text{Hypothesis testing,} \\\\ &amp; \\text{formulate hypotheses} &amp; \\text{estimation, prediction} \\\\[3mm] \\text{Techniques} &amp; \\text{Descriptive statistics,} &amp; \\text{Traditional statistical tools of} \\\\ &amp; \\text{visualization, clustering} &amp; \\text{inference, significance, and}\\\\ &amp; &amp; \\text{confidence} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Table 13.1: Comparison of exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis. Techniques for EDA include descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles), distributions, histograms, correlation analysis, dimension reduction, and cluster analysis. Techniques for CDA include the traditional statistical tools of inference, significance, and confidence. 13.2.3 Supervised versus Unsupervised Methods for data analysis can be divided into two types (Abbott 2014; Igual and Segu 2017): supervised learning methods and unsupervised learning methods. Supervised learning methodsModel that predicts a response target variable using explanatory predictors as input work with labeled data, which include a target variable. Mathematically, supervised learning methods try to approximate the following function: \\[ Y = f(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p), \\] where \\(Y\\) is a target variable and \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(X_p\\) are explanatory variables. Other terms are also used to mean a target variable. Table 13.2 gives a list of common names for different types of variables (Edward W. Frees 2009b). When the target variable is a categorical variable, supervised learning methods are called classification methodsSupervised learning method where the response is a categorical variable. When the target variable is continuous, supervised learning methods are called regression methodsSupervised learning method where the response is a continuous variable. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline \\textbf{Target Variable} &amp; \\textbf{Explanatory Variable}\\\\\\hline \\text{Dependent variable} &amp; \\text{Independent variable}\\\\ \\text{Response} &amp; \\text{Treatment} \\\\ \\text{Output} &amp; \\text{Input} \\\\ \\text{Endogenous variable} &amp; \\text{Exogenous variable} \\\\ \\text{Predicted variable} &amp; \\text{Predictor variable} \\\\ \\text{Regressand} &amp; \\text{Regressor} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Table 13.2: Common names of different variables. Unsupervised learning methodsModels that work with explanatory variables only to describe patterns or groupings work with unlabeled data, which include explanatory variables only. In other words, unsupervised learning methods do not use target variables. As a result, unsupervised learning methods are also called descriptive modeling methods. 13.2.4 Parametric versus Nonparametric Methods for data analysis can be parametric or nonparametric (Abbott 2014). Parametric methods assume that the data follow a certain distribution. Nonparametric methods do not assume distributions for the data and therefore are called distribution-free methods. Parametric methods have the advantage that if the distribution of the data is known, properties of the data and properties of the method (e.g., errors, convergence, coefficients) can be derived. A disadvantage of parametric methods is that analysts need to spend considerable time on figuring out the distribution. For example, analysts may try different transformation methods to transform the data so that it follows a certain distribution. Since nonparametric methods make fewer assumptions, nonparametric methods have the advantage that they are more flexible, more robustStatistics which are more unaffected by outliers or small departures from model assumptions, and applicable to non-quantitative data. However, a drawback of nonparametric methods is that the conclusions drawn from nonparametric methods are not as powerful as those drawn from parametric methods. 13.2.5 Explanation versus Prediction There are two goals in data analysis (Breiman 2001; Shmueli 2010): explanation and prediction. In some scientific areas such as economics, psychology, and environmental science, the focus of data analysis is to explain the causal relationships between the input variables and the response variable. In other scientific areas such as natural language processing and bioinformatics, the focus of data analysis is to predict what the responses are going to be given the input variables. Shmueli (2010) discussed in detail the distinction between explanatory modeling and predictive modeling, which reflect the process of using data and methods for explaining or predicting, respectively. Explanatory modeling is commonly used for theory building and testing. However, predictive modeling is rarely used in many scientific fields as a tool for developing theory. Explanatory modelingProcess where the modeling goal is to identify variables with meaningful and statistically significant relationships and test hypotheses is typically done as follows: State the prevailing theory. State causal hypotheses, which are given in terms of theoretical constructs rather than measurable variables. A causal diagram is usually included to illustrate the hypothesized causal relationship between the theoretical constructs. Operationalize constructs. In this step, previous literature and theoretical justification are used to build a bridge between theoretical constructs and observable measurements. Collect data and build models alongside the statistical hypotheses, which are operationalized from the research hypotheses. Reach research conclusions and recommend policy. The statistical conclusions are converted into research conclusions. Policy recommendations are often accompanied. Shmueli (2010) defined predictive modelingProcess where the modeling goal is to predict new observations as the process of applying a statistical model or data mining algorithm to data for the purpose of predicting new or future observations. Predictions include point predictions, interval predictions, regions, distributions, and rankings of new observations. Predictive model can be any method that produces predictions. 13.2.6 Data Modeling versus Algorithmic Modeling Breiman (2001) discussed two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data: the data modeling culture and the algorithmic modeling culture. In the data modeling culture, the data are assumed to be generated by a given stochastic data model. In the algorithmic modeling culture, the data mechanism is treated as unknown and algorithmic models are used. Data modelingAssumes data generated comes from a stochastic data model gives the statistics field many successes in analyzing data and getting information about the data mechanisms. However, Breiman (2001) argued that the focus on data models in the statistical community has led to some side effects such as Produced irrelevant theory and questionable scientific conclusions. Kept statisticians from using algorithmic models that might be more suitable. Restricted the ability of statisticians to deal with a wide range of problems. Algorithmic modelingAssumes data generated comes from unknown algorithmic models was used by industrial statisticians long time ago. However, the development of algorithmic methods was taken up by a community outside statistics (Breiman 2001). The goal of algorithmic modeling is predictive accuracyQuantitative measure of how well the explanatory variables predict the response outcome. For some complex prediction problems, data models are not suitable. These prediction problems include speech recognition, image recognition, handwriting recognition, nonlinear time series prediction, and financial market prediction. The theory in algorithmic modeling focuses on the properties of algorithms, such as convergence and predictive accuracy. 13.2.7 Big Data Analysis Unlike traditional data analysis, big data analysis employs additional methods and tools that can extract information rapidly from massive data. In particular, big data analysis uses the following processing methods (Chen et al. 2014): Bloom filter A bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to determine whether an element belongs to a set. It has the advantages of high space efficiency and high query speed. A drawback of using bloom filter is that there is a certain misrecognition rate. Hashing Hashing is a method that transforms data into fixed-length numerical values through a hash function. It has the advantages of rapid reading and writing. However, sound hash functions are difficult to find. Indexing Indexing refers to a process of partitioning data in order to speed up reading. Hashing is a special case of indexing. Tries A trie, also called digital tree, is a method to improve query efficiency by using common prefixes of character strings to reduce comparison on character strings to the greatest extent. Parallel computing Parallel computing uses multiple computing resources to complete a computation task. Parallel computing tools include MPI (Message Passing Interface), MapReduce, and Dryad. Big data analysis can be conducted in the following levels (Chen et al. 2014): memory-level, business intelligence (BI) level, and massive level. Memory-level analysis is conducted when the data can be loaded to the memory of a cluster of computers. Current hardware can handle hundreds of gigabytes (GB) of data in memory. BI level analysis can be conducted when the data surpass the memory level. It is common for BI level analysis products to support data over terabytes (TB). Massive level analysis is conducted when the data surpass the capabilities of products for BI level analysis. Usually Hadoop and MapReduce are used in massive level analysis. 13.2.8 Reproducible Analysis As mentioned in Section 13.2.1, a typical data analysis workflow includes collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results. The data collected are saved in a database or files. The data are then analyzed by one or more scriptsA program or sequence of instructions that is executed by another program, which may save some intermediate results or always work on the raw data. Finally a report is produced to describe the results, which include relevant plots, tables, and summaries of the data. The workflow may subject to the following potential issues (Mailund 2017, Chapter 2): The data are separated from the analysis scripts. The documentation of the analysis is separated from the analysis itself. If the analysis is done on the raw data with a single script, then the first issue is not a major problem. If the analysis consists of multiple scripts and a script saves intermediate results that are read by the next script, then the scripts describe a workflow of data analysis. To reproduce an analysis, the scripts have to be executed in the right order. The workflow may cause major problems if the order of the scripts is not documented or the documentation is not updated or lost. One way to address the first issue is to write the scripts so that any part of the workflow can be run completely automatically at any time. If the documentation of the analysis is synchronized with the analysis, then the second issue is not a major problem. However, the documentation may become completely useless if the scripts are changed but the documentation is not updated. Literate programmingCoding practice where documentation and code are written together is an approach to address the two issues mentioned above. In literate programming, the documentation of a program and the code of the program are written together. To do literate programming in R, one way is to use the R Markdown and the \\(\\texttt{knitr}\\) package. 13.2.9 Ethical Issues Analysts may face ethical issues and dilemmas during the data analysis process. In some fields, for example, ethical issues and dilemmas include participant consent, benefits, risk, confidentiality, and data ownershipGovernance process that details legal ownership of enterprise-wide data and outlines who has ability to create, edit, modify, share and restrict access to the data (Miles, Hberman, and Sdana 2014). For data analysis in actuarial science and insurance in particular, we face the following ethical matters and issues (Miles, Hberman, and Sdana 2014): Worthiness of the project Is the project worth doing? Will the project contribute in some significant way to a domain broader than my career? If a project is only opportunistic and does not have a larger significance, then it might be pursued with less care. The result may be looked good but not right. Competence Do I or the whole team have the expertise to carry out the project? Incompetence may lead to weakness in the analytics such as collecting large amounts of data poorly and drawing superficial conclusions. Benefits, costs, and reciprocity Will each stakeholder gain from the project? Are the benefit and the cost equitable? A project will likely to fail if the benefit and the cost for a stakeholder do not match. Privacy and confidentiality How do we make sure that the information is kept confidentially? Where raw data and analysis results are stored and how will have access to them should be documented in explicit confidentiality agreements. Show Quiz Solution 13.3 Data Analysis Techniques Techniques for data analysis are drawn from different but overlapping fields such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. Statistics is a field that addresses reliable ways of gathering data and making inferences based on them (Bandyopadhyay and Forster 2011; Bluman 2012). The term machine learning was coined by Samuel in 1959 (Samuel 1959). Originally, machine learningStudy of algorithms and statistical models that perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference refers to the field of study where computers have the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Nowadays, machine learning has evolved to the broad field of study where computational methods use experience (i.e., the past information available for analysis) to improve performance or to make accurate predictions (Bishop 2007; Clarke, Fokoue, and Zhang 2009; Mohri, Rostamizadeh, and Talwalkar 2012; Kubat 2017). There are four types of machine learning algorithms (See Table 13.3 depending on the type of the data and the type of the learning tasks. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{rll} \\hline &amp; \\textbf{Supervised} &amp; \\textbf{Unsupervised} \\\\\\hline \\textbf{Discrete Label} &amp; \\text{Classification} &amp; \\text{Clustering} \\\\ \\textbf{Continuous Label} &amp; \\text{Regression} &amp; \\text{Dimension reduction} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Table 13.3: Types of machine learning algorithms. Originating in engineering, pattern recognitionAutomated recognition of patterns and regularities in data is a field that is closely related to machine learning, which grew out of computer science. In fact, pattern recognition and machine learning can be considered to be two facets of the same field (Bishop 2007). Data miningProcess of collecting, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and discovering patterns and useful insights from large data sets is a field that concerns collecting, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and gaining useful insights from data (Aggarwal 2015). 13.3.1 Exploratory Techniques Exploratory data analysis techniques include descriptive statistics as well as many unsupervised learning techniques such as data clustering and principal component analysis. 13.3.1.1 Descriptive Statistics In the mass noun sense, descriptive statistics is an area of statistics that concerns the collection, organization, summarization, and presentation of data (Bluman 2012). In the count noun sense, descriptive statistics are summary statistics that quantitatively describe or summarize data. \\[\\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline &amp; \\textbf{Descriptive Statistics} \\\\\\hline \\text{Measures of central tendency} &amp; \\text{Mean, median, mode, midrange}\\\\ \\text{Measures of variation} &amp; \\text{Range, variance, standard deviation} \\\\ \\text{Measures of position} &amp; \\text{Quantile} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix} \\] Table 13.4: Some commonly used descriptive statistics. Table 13.4 lists some commonly used descriptive statistics. In R, we can use the function \\(\\texttt{summary}\\) to calculate some of the descriptive statistics. For numeric data, we can visualize the descriptive statistics using a boxplot. In addition to these quantitative descriptive statistics, we can also qualitatively describe shapes of the distributions (Bluman 2012). For example, we can say that a distribution is positively skewed, symmetric, or negatively skewed. To visualize the distribution of a variable, we can draw a histogram. 13.3.1.2 Principal Component Analysis Principal component analysisDimension reduction technique that uses orthogonal transformations to convert a set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables (PCA) is a statistical procedure that transforms a dataset described by possibly correlated variables into a dataset described by linearly uncorrelated variables, which are called principal components and are ordered according to their variances. PCA is a technique for dimension reduction. If the original variables are highly correlated, then the first few principal components can account for most of the variation of the original data. The principal components of the variables are related to the eigenvectors and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the variables. For \\(i=1,2,\\ldots,d\\), let \\((\\lambda_i, \\textbf{e}_i)\\) be the \\(i\\)th eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of the covariance matrix \\({\\Sigma}\\) of \\(d\\) variables \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_d\\) such that \\(\\lambda_1\\ge \\lambda_2\\ge \\ldots\\ge \\lambda_d\\ge 0\\) and the eigenvectors are normalized. Then the \\(i\\)th principal component is given by \\[Z_{i} = \\textbf{e}_i&#39; \\textbf{X} =\\sum_{j=1}^d e_{ij} X_j,\\] where \\(\\textbf{X}=(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_d)&#39;\\). It can be shown that \\(\\mathrm{Var~}{(Z_i)} = \\lambda_i\\). As a result, the proportion of variance explained by the \\(i\\)th principal component is calculated as \\[\\dfrac{\\mathrm{Var~}{(Z_i)}}{ \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\mathrm{Var~}{(Z_j)}} = \\dfrac{\\lambda_i}{\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2+\\cdots+\\lambda_d}.\\] For more information about PCA, readers are referred to Mirkin (2011). 13.3.1.3 Cluster Analysis Cluster analysisUnsupervised learning method that aims to splot data into homogenous groups using a similarity measure (aka data clustering) refers to the process of dividing a dataset into homogeneous groups or clusters such that points in the same cluster are similar and points from different clusters are quite distinct (Gan, Ma, and Wu 2007; Gan 2011). Data clustering is one of the most popular tools for exploratory data analysis and has found applications in many scientific areas. During the past several decades, many clustering algorithms have been proposed. Among these clustering algorithms, the \\(k\\)-means algorithm is perhaps the most well-known algorithm due to its simplicity. To describe the k-means algorithmType of clustering that aims to partition data into k mutually exclusive clusters by assigning observations to the cluster with the nearest centroid, let \\(X=\\{\\textbf{x}_1,\\textbf{x}_2,\\ldots,\\textbf{x}_n\\}\\) be a dataset containing \\(n\\) points, each of which is described by \\(d\\) numerical features. Given a desired number of clusters \\(k\\), the \\(k\\)-means algorithm aims at minimizing the following objective function: \\[P(U,Z) = \\sum_{l=1}^k\\sum_{i=1}^n u_{il} \\Vert \\textbf{x}_i-\\textbf{z}_l\\Vert^2,\\] where \\(U=(u_{il})_{n\\times k}\\) is an \\(n\\times k\\) partition matrix, \\(Z=\\{\\textbf{z}_1,\\textbf{z}_2,\\ldots,\\textbf{z}_k\\}\\) is a set of cluster centers, and \\(\\Vert\\cdot\\Vert\\) is the \\(L^2\\) norm or Euclidean distance. The partition matrix \\(U\\) satisfies the following conditions: \\[u_{il}\\in \\{0,1\\},\\quad i=1,2,\\ldots,n,\\:l=1,2,\\ldots,k,\\] \\[\\sum_{l=1}^k u_{il}=1,\\quad i=1,2,\\ldots,n.\\] The \\(k\\)-means algorithm employs an iterative procedure to minimize the objective function. It repeatedly updates the partition matrix \\(U\\) and the cluster centers \\(Z\\) alternately until some stop criterion is met. For more information about \\(k\\)-means, readers are referred to Gan, Ma, and Wu (2007) and Mirkin (2011). 13.3.2 Confirmatory Techniques Confirmatory data analysis techniques include the traditional statistical tools of inference, significance, and confidence. 13.3.2.1 Linear Models Linear models, also called linear regression modelsSupervised model that uses a linear function to approximate the relationship between the target and explanatory variables, aim at using a linear function to approximate the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables. A linear regression model is called a simple linear regression model if there is only one independent variable. When more than one independent variables are involved, a linear regression model is called a multiple linear regression model. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) denote the independent and the dependent variables, respectively. For \\(i=1,2,\\ldots,n\\), let \\((x_i, y_i)\\) be the observed values of \\((X,Y)\\) in the \\(i\\)th case. Then the simple linear regression model is specified as follows (Edward W. Frees 2009b): \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i,\\quad i=1,2,\\ldots,n,\\] where \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are parameters and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is a random variable representing the error for the \\(i\\)th case. When there are multiple independent variables, the following multiple linear regression model is used: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{ik} + \\epsilon_i,\\] where \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\beta_k\\) are unknown parameters to be estimated. Linear regression models usually make the following assumptions: \\(x_{i1},x_{i2},\\ldots,x_{ik}\\) are nonstochastic variables. \\(\\mathrm{Var~}(y_i)=\\sigma^2\\), where \\(\\mathrm{Var~}(y_i)\\) denotes the variance of \\(y_i\\). \\(y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_n\\) are independent random variables. For the purpose of obtaining tests and confidence statements with small samples, the following strong normality assumption is also made: \\(\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2,\\ldots,\\epsilon_n\\) are normally distributed. 13.3.2.2 Generalized Linear Models The generalized linear modelSupervised model that generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear component to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value (GLM) is a wide family of regression models that include linear regression models as special cases. In a GLM, the mean of the response (i.e., the dependent variable) is assumed to be a function of linear combinations of the explanatory variables, i.e., \\[\\mu_i = E[y_i],\\] \\[\\eta_i = \\textbf{x}_i&#39;\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = g(\\mu_i),\\] where \\(\\textbf{x}_i=(1,x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ik})&#39;\\) is a vector of regressor values, \\(\\mu_i\\) is the mean response for the \\(i\\)th case, and \\(\\eta_i\\) is a systematic componentThe linear combination of explanatory variables component in a glm of the GLMGeneralized linear model. The function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is known and is called the link functionFunction that relates between the linear predictor component to the mean of the target variable. The mean response can vary by observations by allowing some parameters to change. However, the regression parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) are assumed to be the same among different observations. GLMs make the following assumptions: \\(x_{i1},x_{i2},\\ldots,x_{in}\\) are nonstochastic variables. \\(y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_n\\) are independent. The dependent variable is assumed to follow a distribution from the linear exponential family. The variance of the dependent variable is not assumed to be constant but is a function of the mean, i.e., \\[\\mathrm{Var~}{(y_i)} = \\phi \\nu(\\mu_i),\\] where \\(\\phi\\) denotes the dispersion parameter and \\(\\nu(\\cdot)\\) is a function. As we can see from the above specification, the GLM provides a unifying framework to handle different types of dependent variables, including discrete and continuous variables. For more information about GLMs, readers are referred to Jong and Heller (2008) and Edward W. Frees (2009b). 13.3.2.3 Tree-based Models Decision treesModeling technique that uses a tree-like model of decisions to divide the sample space into non-overlapping regions to make predictions, also known as tree-based models, involve dividing the predictor space (i.e., the space formed by independent variables) into a number of simple regions and using the mean or the mode of the region for prediction (Breiman et al. 1984). There are two types of tree-based models: classification trees and regression trees. When the dependent variable is categorical, the resulting tree models are called classification trees. When the dependent variable is continuous, the resulting tree models are called regression trees. The process of building classification trees is similar to that of building regression trees. Here we only briefly describe how to build a regression tree. To do that, the predictor space is divided into non-overlapping regions such that the following objective function \\[f(R_1,R_2,\\ldots,R_J) = \\sum_{j=1}^J \\sum_{i=1}^n I_{R_j}(\\textbf{x}_i)(y_i - \\mu_j)^2\\] is minimized, where \\(I\\) is an indicator function, \\(R_j\\) denotes the set of indices of the observations that belong to the \\(j\\)th box, \\(\\mu_j\\) is the mean response of the observations in the \\(j\\)th box, \\(\\textbf{x}_i\\) is the vector of predictor values for the \\(i\\)th observation, and \\(y_i\\) is the response value for the \\(i\\)th observation. In terms of predictive accuracy, decision trees generally do not perform to the level of other regression and classification models. However, tree-based models may outperform linear models when the relationship between the response and the predictors is nonlinear. For more information about decision trees, readers are referred to Breiman et al. (1984) and Mitchell (1997).

In practice, there are many types of variables that one encounter and the first step in dependence modeling is identifying the type of variable you are dealing with to help direct you to the appropriate technique. This chapter introduces readers to variable types and techniques for modeling dependence or association of multivariate distributions. Section 14.1 provides an overview of the types of variables. Section 14.2 then elaborates basic measures for modeling the dependence between variables. Section 14.3 introduces a novel approach to modeling dependence using Copulas which is reinforced with practical illustrations in Section 14.4. The types of Copula families and basic properties of Copula functions is explained Section 14.5. The chapter concludes by explaining why the study of dependence modeling is important in Section 14.6. 14.1 Variable Types In this section, you learn how to: Classify variables as qualitative or quantitative. Describe multivariate variables. People, firms, and other entities that we want to understand are described in a dataset by numerical characteristics. As these characteristics vary by entity, they are commonly known as variablesA variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted.. To manage insurance systems, it will be critical to understand the distribution of each variable and how they are associated with one another. It is common for data sets to have many variables (high dimensionalData set is high dimensional when it has many variables. In many applications, the number of variables may be larger than the sample size.) and so it useful to begin by classifying them into different types. As will be seen, these classifications are not strict; there is overlap among the groups. Nonetheless, the grouping summarized in Table 14.1 and explained in the remainder of this section provides a solid first step in framing a data set. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|l} \\hline \\textbf{Variable Type} &amp; \\textbf{Example} \\\\\\hline Qualitative &amp; \\\\ \\text{Binary} &amp; \\text{Sex} \\\\ \\text{Categorical (Unordered, Nominal)} &amp; \\text{Territory (e.g., state/province) in which an insured resides} \\\\ \\text{Ordered Category (Ordinal)} &amp; \\text{Claimant satisfaction (five point scale ranging from 1=dissatisfied} \\\\ &amp; ~~~ \\text{to 5 =satisfied)} \\\\\\hline Quantitative &amp; \\\\ \\text{Continuous} &amp; \\text{Policyholder&#39;s age, weight, income} \\\\ \\text{Discrete} &amp; \\text{Amount of deductible (0, 250, 500, and 1000)} \\\\ \\text{Count} &amp; \\text{Number of insurance claims} \\\\ \\text{Combinations of} &amp; \\text{Policy losses, mixture of 0&#39;s (for no loss)} \\\\ ~~~ \\text{Discrete and Continuous} &amp; ~~~\\text{and positive claim amount} \\\\ \\text{Interval Variable} &amp; \\text{Driver Age: 16-24 (young), 25-54 (intermediate),} \\\\ &amp; ~~~\\text{55 and over (senior)} \\\\ \\text{Circular Data} &amp; \\text{Time of day measures of customer arrival} \\\\ \\hline Multivariate ~ Variable &amp; \\\\ \\text{High Dimensional Data} &amp; \\text{Characteristics of a firm purchasing worker&#39;s compensation} \\\\ &amp; ~~~\\text{insurance (location of plants, industry, number of employees,} \\\\ &amp;~~~\\text{and so on)} \\\\ \\text{Spatial Data} &amp; \\text{Longitude/latitude of the location an insurance hailstorm claim} \\\\ \\text{Missing Data} &amp; \\text{Policyholder&#39;s age (continuous/interval) and &quot;-99&quot; for} \\\\ &amp;~~~ \\text{&quot;not reported,&quot; that is, missing} \\\\ \\text{Censored and Truncated Data} &amp; \\text{Amount of insurance claims in excess of a deductible} \\\\ \\text{Aggregate Claims} &amp; \\text{Losses recorded for each claim in a motor vehicle policy.} \\\\ \\text{Stochastic Process Realizations} &amp; \\text{The time and amount of each occurrence of an insured loss} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}} \\] Table 14.1 : Variable types In data analysis, it is important to understand what type of variable you are working with. For example, Consider a pair of random variables (Coverage,Claim) from the LGPIF data introduced in chapter 1 as displayed in Figure 14.1 below. We would like to know whether the distribution of Coverage depends on the distribution of Claim or whether they are statistically independent. We would also want to know how the Claim distribution depends on the EntityType variable. Because the EntityType variable belongs to a different class of variables, modeling the dependence between Claim and Coverage may require a different technique from that of Claim and EntityType. Figure 14.1: Scatter plot of (Coverage,Claim) from LGPIF data 14.1.1 Qualitative Variables In this sub-section, you learn how to: Classify qualitative variables as nominal or ordinal Describe binary variable A qualitativeThis is a type of variable in which the measurement denotes membership in a set of groups, or categories, or categorical variableA variable whose values are qualitative groups and can have no natural ordering (nominal) or an ordering (ordinal) is one for which the measurement denotes membership in a set of groups, or categories. For example, if you were coding which area of the country an insured resides, you might use a 1 for the northern part, 2 for southern, and 3 for everything else. This location variable is an example of a nominal variableThis is a type of qualitative/ categorical variable which has two or more categories without having any kind of natural order., one for which the levels have no natural ordering. Any analysis of nominal variables should not depend on the labeling of the categories. For example, instead of using a 1,2,3 for north, south, other, I should arrive at the same set of summary statistics if I used a 2,1,3 coding instead, interchanging north and south. In contrast, an ordinal variableThis is a type of qualitative/ categorical variable which has two or more ordered categories. is a type of categorical variable for which an ordering does exist. For example, with a survey to see how satisfied customers are with our claims servicing department, we might use a five point scale that ranges from 1 meaning dissatisfied to a 5 meaning satisfied. Ordinal variables provide a clear ordering of levels of a variable but the amount of separation between levels is unknown. A binary variableIs a special type of categorical variable where there are only two categories. is a special type of categorical variable where there are only two categories commonly taken to be a 0 and a 1. For example, we might code a variable in a dataset to be a 1 if an insured is female and a 0 if male. 14.1.2 Quantitative Variables In this sub-section, you learn how to: Differentiate between continuous and discrete variable Use a combination of continuous and discrete variable Describe circular data Unlike a qualitative variable, a quantitative variableA quantitative variable is a type of variable in which numerical level is a realization from some scale so that the distance between any two levels of the scale takes on meaning. is one in which numerical level is a realization from some scale so that the distance between any two levels of the scale takes on meaning. A continuous variableA continuous variable is a quantitative variable that can take on any value within a finite interval. is one that can take on any value within a finite interval. For example, it is common to represent a policyholderPerson in actual possession of insurance policy; policy owner.’s age, weight, or income, as a continuous variable. In contrast, a discrete variableA discrete variable is quantitative variable that takes on only a finite number of values in any finite interval. is one that takes on only a finite number of values in any finite interval. For example, when examining a policyholder’s choice of deductiblesA deductible is a parameter specified in the contract. Typically, losses below the deductible are paid by the policyholder whereas losses in excess of the deductible are the insurer’s responsibility (subject to policy limits and coninsurance)., it may be that values of 0, 250, 500, and 1000 are the only possible outcomes. Like an ordinal variable, these represent distinct categories that are ordered. Unlike an ordinal variable, the numerical difference between levels takes on economic meaning. A special type of discrete variable is a count variableA count variable is a discrete variable with values on nonnegative integers., one with values on the nonnegative integers. For example, we will be particularly interested in the number of claims arising from a policy during a given period. Some variables are inherently a combination of discrete and continuous components. For example, when we analyze the insured lossThe amount of damages sustained by an individual or corporation, typically as the result of an insurable event. of a policyholder, we will encounter a discrete outcome at zero, representing no insured loss, and a continuous amount for positive outcomes, representing the amount of the insured loss. Another interesting variation is an interval variableAn ordinal variable with the additional property that the magnitudes of the differences between two values are meaningful,one that gives a range of possible outcomes. Circular dataIn a circular data, all values around the circle are equally likely. Example, imagine an analog picture of a clock. represent an interesting category typically not analyzed by insurersAn insurance company authorized to write insurance under the laws of any state.. As an example of circular data, suppose that you monitor calls to your customer service center and would like to know when is the peak time of the day for calls to arrive. In this context, one can think about the time of the day as a variable with realizations on a circle, e.g., imagine an analog picture of a clock. For circular data, the distance between observations at 00:15 and 00:45 are just as close as observations 23:45 and 00:15 (here, we use the convention HH:MM means hours and minutes). 14.1.3 Multivariate Variables In this sub-section, you learn how to: Differentiate between univariate and multivariate data Handle missing variables Insurance data typically are multivariateMultivariate variable involves taking many measurements on a single entity. in the sense that we can take many measurements on a single entity. For example, when studying losses associated with a firm’s worker’s compensationInsurance that covers an employer’s liability for injuries, disability or death to persons in their employment, without regard to fault, as prescribed by state or federal workers’ compensation laws and other statutes. plan, we might want to know the location of its manufacturing plants, the industry in which it operates, the number of employees, and so forth. The usual strategy for analyzing multivariate data is to begin by examining each variable in isolation of the others. This is known as a univariateUnivariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. “Uni” means “one”, so in other words your data has only one variable. approach. In contrast, for some variables, it makes little sense to only look at one dimensional aspects. For example, insurers typically organize spatial dataData and information having an implicit or explicit association with a location relative to the earth by longitude and latitude to analyze the location of weather related insurance claims due hailstorms. Having only a single number, either longitude or latitude, provides little information in understanding geographical location. Another special case of a multivariate variable, less obvious, involves coding for missing dataMissing data occur when no data value is stored for a variable in an observation. Missing data can occur because of nonresponse: no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit or subject.. Historically, some statistical packages used a -99 to report when a variable, such as policyholder’s age, was not available or not reported. This led to many unsuspecting analysts providing strange statistics when summarizing a set of data. When data are missing, it is better to think about the variable as two dimensions, one to indicate whether or not the variable is reported and the second providing the age (if reported). In the same way, insurance data are commonly censoredCensored data have unknown values beyond a bound on either end of the number line or both. Here, the data is observed but the values (measurements) are not known completely. and truncatedTruncation occurs when values beyond a boundary are either excluded when gathered or excluded when analyzed. An object can be detected only if its value is greater than some number.. We refer you to Chapter 4 for more on censored and truncated data. Aggregate claimsThe sum of all claims observed in a period of time can also be coded as another special type of multivariate variable. We refer you to Chapter 5 for more Aggregate claims. Perhaps the most complicated type of multivariate variable is a realization of a stochastic processStochastic process is defined as a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set.. You will recall that a stochastic process is little more than a collection of random variables. For example, in insurance, we might think about the times that claims arrive to an insurance company in a one year time horizon. This is a high dimensional variable that theoretically is infinite dimensional. Special techniques are required to understand realizations of stochastic processes that will not be addressed here. Show Quiz Solution 14.2 Classic Measures of Scalar Associations In this section, you learn how to: Estimate correlation using Pearson method Use rank based measures like Spearman, Kendall to estimate correlation Measure dependence using odds ratio, Pearson chi-square and likelihood ratio test statistic Use normal-based correlations to quantify associations involving ordinal variables 14.2.1 Association Measures for Quantitative Variables For this section, consider a pair of random variables \\((X,Y)\\) having joint distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) and a random sample \\((X_i,Y_i), i=1, \\ldots, n\\). For the continuous case, suppose that \\(F(\\cdot)\\) is absolutely continuous with absolutely continuous marginals. 14.2.1.1 Pearson Correlation Define the sample covariance function \\(\\widehat{Cov}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\\), where \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\) are the sample means of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively. Then, the product-moment (Pearson) correlationPearson correlation, a measure of the linear correlation between two variables can be written as \\[\\begin{equation*} r = \\frac{\\widehat{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{Cov}(X,X)\\widehat{Cov}(Y,Y)}}. \\end{equation*}\\] The correlation statistic \\(r\\) is widely used to capture linear association between random variables. It is a (nonparametric) estimator of the correlation parameter \\(\\rho\\), defined to be the covariance divided by the product of standard deviations. In this sense, it captures association for any pair of random variables. This statistic has several important features. Unlike regression estimators, it is symmetric between random variables, so the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) equals the correlation between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\). It is unchanged by linear transformations of random variables (up to sign changes) so that we can multiply random variables or add constants as is helpful for interpretation. The range of the statistic is \\([-1,1]\\) which does not depend on the distribution of either \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\). Further, in the case of independence, the correlation coefficient \\(r\\) is 0. However, it is well known that zero correlation does not imply independence, except for normally distributed random variables. The correlation statistic \\(r\\) is also a (maximum likelihood) estimator of the association parameter for bivariate normal distribution. So, for normally distributed data, the correlation statistic \\(r\\) can be used to assess independence. For additional interpretations of this well-known statistic, readers will enjoy (Lee Rodgers and Nicewander 1998). You can obtain the Pearson correlationA measure of the linear correlation between two variables statistic \\(r\\) using the cor() function in R and selecting the pearson method. This is demonstrated below by using the Coverage rating variable in millions of dollars and Claim amount variable in dollars from the LGPIF data introduced in chapter 1. R Code for Pearson Correlation Statistic ### Pearson correlation between Claim and Coverage r&lt;-cor(Claim,Coverage, method = c(&quot;pearson&quot;)) round(r,2) Output: [1] 0.31 ### Pearson correlation between Claim and log(Coverage) r&lt;-cor(Claim,log(Coverage), method = c(&quot;pearson&quot;)) round(r,2) Output: [1] 0.1 From R output above, \\(r=0.31\\) , which indicates a positive association between Claim and Coverage. This means that as the coverage amount of a policy increases we expect claim to increase. 14.2.2 Rank Based Measures 14.2.2.1 Spearman’s Rho The Pearson correlation coefficient does have the drawback that it is not invariant to nonlinear transforms of the data. For example, the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(\\ln Y\\) can be quite different from the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). As we see from the R code for Pearson correlation statistic above, the correlation statistic \\(r\\) between Coverage rating variable in logarithmic millions of dollars and Claim amounts variable in dollars is \\(0.1\\) as compared to \\(0.31\\) when we calculate the correlation between Coverage rating variable in millions of dollars and Claim amounts variable in dollars. This limitation is one reason for considering alternative statistics. Alternative measures of correlation are based on ranks of the data. Let \\(R(X_j)\\) denote the rank of \\(X_j\\) from the sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) and similarly for \\(R(Y_j)\\). Let \\(R(X) = \\left(R(X_1), \\ldots, R(X_n)\\right)&#39;\\) denote the vector of ranks, and similarly for \\(R(Y)\\). For example, if \\(n=3\\) and \\(X=(24, 13, 109)\\), then \\(R(X)=(2,1,3)\\). A comprehensive introduction of rank statistics can be found in, for example, (Hettmansperger 1984). Also, ranks can be used to obtain the empirical distribution function, refer to section 4.1.1 for more on the empirical distribution function. With this, the correlation measure of (Spearman 1904) is simply the product-moment correlation computed on the ranks: \\[\\begin{equation*} r_S = \\frac{\\widehat{Cov}(R(X),R(Y))}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{Cov}(R(X),R(X))\\widehat{Cov}(R(Y),R(Y))}} = \\frac{\\widehat{Cov}(R(X),R(Y))}{(n^2-1)/12} . \\end{equation*}\\] You can obtain the Spearman correlation statistic \\(r_S\\) using the cor() function in R and selecting the spearman method. From below, the Spearman correlation between the Coverage rating variable in millions of dollars and Claim amount variable in dollars is \\(0.41\\). R Code for Spearman Correlation Statistic ### Spearman correlation between Claim and Coverage ### rs&lt;-cor(Claim,Coverage, method = c(&quot;spearman&quot;)) round(rs,2) Output: [1] 0.41 ### Spearman correlation between Claim and log(Coverage) ### rs&lt;-cor(Claim,log(Coverage), method = c(&quot;spearman&quot;)) round(rs,2) Output: [1] 0.41 We can show that the Spearman correlation statistic is invariant under strictly increasing transformations. From the R Code for Spearman correlation statistic above, \\(r_S=0.41\\) between the Coverage rating variable in logarithmic millions of dollars and Claim amount variable in dollars. 14.2.2.2 Kendall’s Tau An alternative measure that uses ranks is based on the concept of concordance. An observation pair \\((X,Y)\\) is said to be concordantAn observation pair (x,y) is said to be concordant if the observation with a larger value of x has also the larger value of y (discordantAn observation pair (x,y) is said to be discordant if the observation with a larger value of x has the smaller value of y) if the observation with a larger value of \\(X\\) has also the larger (smaller) value of \\(Y\\). Then \\(\\Pr(concordance) = \\Pr[ (X_1-X_2)(Y_1-Y_2) &gt;0 ]\\) , \\(\\Pr(discordance) = \\Pr[ (X_1-X_2)(Y_1-Y_2) &lt;0 ]\\), \\(\\Pr(tie) = \\Pr[ (X_1-X_2)(Y_1-Y_2) =0 ]\\) and \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\tau(X,Y)= \\Pr(concordance) - \\Pr(discordance) = 2\\Pr(concordance) - 1 + \\Pr(tie). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] To estimate this, the pairs \\((X_i,Y_i)\\) and \\((X_j,Y_j)\\) are said to be concordant if the product \\(sgn(X_j-X_i)sgn(Y_j-Y_i)\\) equals 1 and discordant if the product equals -1. Here, \\(sgn(x)=1,0,-1\\) as \\(x&gt;0\\), \\(x=0\\), \\(x&lt;0\\), respectively. With this, we can express the association measure of (Kendall 1938), known as Kendall’s tau, as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\begin{array}{rl} \\tau &amp;= \\frac{2}{n(n-1)} \\sum_{i&lt;j}sgn(X_j-X_i)sgn(Y_j-Y_i)\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2}{n(n-1)} \\sum_{i&lt;j}sgn(R(X_j)-R(X_i))sgn(R(Y_j)-R(Y_i)) \\end{array}. \\end{equation*}\\] Interestingly, (Hougaard 2000), page 137, attributes the original discovery of this statistic to (Fechner 1897), noting that Kendall’s discovery was independent and more complete than the original work. You can obtain the Kendall’s tau, using the cor() function in R and selecting the kendall method. From below, \\(\\tau=0.32\\) between the Coverage rating variable in millions of dollars and Claim amount variable in dollars. When there are ties in the data, the cor() function computes Kendall’s tau_b, as proposed by (Kendall 1945). R Code for Kendall’s Tau ### Kendall&#39;s tau correlation between Claim and Coverage ### tau&lt;-cor(Claim,Coverage, method = c(&quot;kendall&quot;)) round(tau,2) Output: [1] 0.32 ### Kendall&#39;s tau correlation between Claim and log(Coverage) ### tau&lt;-cor(Claim,log(Coverage), method = c(&quot;kendall&quot;)) round(tau,2) Output: [1] 0.32 Also,to show that the Kendall’s tau is invariate under strictly increasing transformations , \\(\\tau=0.32\\) between the Coverage rating variable in logarithmic millions of dollars and Claim amount variable in dollars. 14.2.3 Nominal Variables 14.2.3.1 Bernoulli Variables To see why dependence measures for continuous variables may not be the best for discrete variables, let us focus on the case of Bernoulli variables that take on simple binary outcomes, 0 and 1. For notation, let \\(\\pi_{jk} = \\Pr(X=j, Y=k)\\) for \\(j,k=0,1\\) and let \\(\\pi_X=\\Pr(X=1)\\) and similarly for \\(\\pi_Y\\). Then, the population version of the product-moment (Pearson) correlation can be easily seen to be \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\rho = \\frac{\\pi_{11} - \\pi_X \\pi_Y}{\\sqrt{\\pi_X(1-\\pi_X)\\pi_Y(1-\\pi_Y)}} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Unlike the case for continuous data, it is not possible for this measure to achieve the limiting boundaries of the interval \\([-1,1]\\). To see this, students of probability may recall the Fr\\(\\acute{e}\\)chet-H\\(\\ddot{o}\\)effding bounds for a joint distribution that turn out to be \\(\\max\\{0, \\pi_X+\\pi_Y-1\\} \\le \\pi_{11} \\le \\min\\{\\pi_X,\\pi_Y\\}\\) for this joint probability. This limit on the joint probability imposes an additional restriction on the Pearson correlation. As an illustration, assume equal probabilities \\(\\pi_X =\\pi_Y = \\pi &gt; 1/2\\). Then, the lower bound is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{2\\pi - 1 - \\pi^2}{\\pi(1-\\pi)} = -\\frac{1-\\pi}{\\pi} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] For example, if \\(\\pi=0.8\\), then the smallest that the Pearson correlation could be is -0.25. More generally, there are bounds on \\(\\rho\\) that depend on \\(\\pi_X\\) and \\(\\pi_Y\\) that make it difficult to interpret this measure. As noted by (Bishop, Fienberg, and Holland 1975) (page 382), squaring this correlation coefficient yields the Pearson chi-square statistic (introduced in chapter 2) . Despite the boundary problems described above, this feature makes the Pearson correlation coefficient a good choice for describing dependence with binary data. The other is the odds ratio, described as follows. As an alternative measure for Bernoulli variables, the odds ratioA statistic quantifying the strength of the association between two events, a and b, which is defined as the ratio of the odds of a in the presence of b and the odds of a in the absence of b is given by \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} OR(\\pi_{11}) = \\frac{\\pi_{11} \\pi_{00}}{\\pi_{01} \\pi_{10}} = \\frac{\\pi_{11} \\left( 1+\\pi_{11}-\\pi_X -\\pi_Y\\right)}{(\\pi_X-\\pi_{11})(\\pi_Y- \\pi_{11})} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Pleasant calculations show that \\(OR(z)\\) is \\(0\\) at the lower Fr\\(\\acute{e}\\)chet-H\\(\\ddot{o}\\)effding bound \\(z= \\max\\{0, \\pi_X+\\pi_Y-1\\}\\) and is \\(\\infty\\) at the upper bound \\(z=\\min\\{\\pi_X,\\pi_Y\\}\\). Thus, the bounds on this measure do not depend on the marginal probabilities \\(\\pi_X\\) and \\(\\pi_Y\\), making it easier to interpret this measure. As noted by (Yule 1900), odds ratios are invariant to the labeling of 0 and 1. Further, they are invariant to the marginals in the sense that one can rescale \\(\\pi_X\\) and \\(\\pi_Y\\) by positive constants and the odds ratio remains unchanged. Specifically, suppose that \\(a_i\\), \\(b_j\\) are sets of positive constants and that \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\pi_{ij}^{new} &amp;=&amp; a_i b_j \\pi_{ij} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] and \\(\\sum_{ij} \\pi_{ij}^{new}=1.\\) Then, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} OR^{new} = \\frac{(a_1 b_1 \\pi_{11})( a_0 b_0 \\pi_{00})}{(a_0 b_1 \\pi_{01})( a_1 b_0\\pi_{10})} = \\frac{\\pi_{11} \\pi_{00}}{\\pi_{01} \\pi_{10}} =OR^{old} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] For additional help with interpretation, Yule proposed two transforms for the odds ratio, the first in (Yule 1900), \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{OR-1}{OR+1}, \\end{eqnarray*}\\] and the second in (Yule 1912), \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{\\sqrt{OR}-1}{\\sqrt{OR}+1}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Although these statistics provide the same information as is the original odds ration \\(OR\\), they have the advantage of taking values in the interval \\([-1,1]\\), making them easier to interpret. In a later section, we will also see that the marginal distributions have no effect on the Fr\\(\\acute{e}\\)chet-H\\(\\ddot{o}\\)effding of the tetrachoric correlationA technique for estimating the correlation between two theorised normally distributed continuous latent variables, from two observed binary variables, another measure of association, see also, (Joe 2014), page 48. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|rr|r} \\hline &amp; \\text{Fire5} &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{NoClaimCredit} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\text{Total} \\\\ \\hline 0 &amp; 1611 &amp; 2175 &amp; 3786 \\\\ 1 &amp; 897 &amp; 956 &amp; 1853 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; 2508 &amp; 3131 &amp; 5639 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}} \\] Table 14.2 : 2 \\(\\times\\) 2 table of counts for Fire5 and NoClaimCredit variables from LGPIF data.

For a two-way table of counts, let \\(n_{jk}\\) be the number in the \\(j\\)th row, \\(k\\) column. Let \\(n_{j\\centerdot}\\) be the row margin total, \\(n_{\\centerdot k}\\) be the column margin total and \\(n=\\sum_{j,k} n_{j,k}\\). Define Pearson chi-square statisticA statistical test applied to sets of categorical data to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance as \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\chi^2 = \\sum_{jk} \\frac{(n_{jk}- n_{j\\centerdot}n_{\\centerdot k}/n)^2}{n_{j\\centerdot}n_{\\centerdot k}/n} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The likelihood ratio testA statistical test of the goodness-of-fit between two models statistic is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} G^2 = 2 \\sum_{jk} n_{jk} \\ln\\frac{n_{jk}}{n_{j\\centerdot}n_{\\centerdot k}/n} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Under the assumption of independence, both \\(\\chi^2\\) and \\(G^2\\) have an asymptotic chi-square distribution with \\((ncat_X-1)(ncat_Y-1)\\) degrees of freedom. To help see what these statistics are estimating, let \\(\\pi_{jk} = \\Pr(X=j, Y=k)\\) and let \\(\\pi_{X,j}=\\Pr(X=j)\\) and similarly for \\(\\pi_{Y,k}\\). Assuming that \\(n_{jk}/n \\approx \\pi_{jk}\\) for large \\(n\\) and similarly for the marginal probabilities, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{\\chi^2}{n} \\approx \\sum_{jk} \\frac{(\\pi_{jk}- \\pi_{X,j}\\pi_{Y,k})^2}{\\pi_{X,j}\\pi_{Y,k}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] and \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{G^2}{n} \\approx 2 \\sum_{jk} \\pi_{jk} \\ln\\frac{\\pi_{jk}}{\\pi_{X,j}\\pi_{Y,k}} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Under the null hypothesis of independence, we have \\(\\pi_{jk} =\\pi_{X,j}\\pi_{Y,k}\\) and it is clear from these approximations that we anticipate that these statistics will be small under this hypothesis. Classical approaches, as described in (Bishop, Fienberg, and Holland 1975) (page 374), distinguish between tests of independence and measures of associations. The former are designed to detect whether a relationship exists whereas the latter are meant to assess the type and extent of a relationship. We acknowledge these differing purposes but also less concerned with this distinction for actuarial applications. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|rr} \\hline &amp; \\text{NoClaimCredit} &amp; \\\\ \\text{EntityType} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\hline \\text{City} &amp; 644 &amp; 149 \\\\ \\text{County} &amp; 310 &amp; 18 \\\\ \\text{Misc} &amp; 336 &amp; 273 \\\\ \\text{School} &amp; 1103 &amp; 494 \\\\ \\text{Town} &amp; 492 &amp; 479 \\\\ \\text{Village} &amp; 901 &amp; 440 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}} \\] Table 14.3 : Two-way table of counts for EntityType and NoClaimCredit variables from LGPIF data.

The first is breaking the precise continuous measurements into groups. The second is losing the ordering of the groups. So, it is sensible to describe what we can do with variables that in discrete groups but where the ordering is known. As described in Section 14.1.1, ordinal variables provide a clear ordering of levels of a variable but distances between levels are unknown. Associations have traditionally been quantified parametrically using normal-based correlations and nonparametrically using Spearman correlations with tied ranks. 14.2.4.1 Parametric Approach Using Normal Based Correlations Refer to page 60, Section 2.12.7 of (Joe 2014). Let \\((y_1,y_2)\\) be a bivariate pair with discrete values on \\(m_1, \\ldots, m_2\\). For a two-way table of ordinal counts, let \\(n_{st}\\) be the number in the \\(s\\)th row, \\(t\\) column. Let \\((n_{m_1\\centerdot}, \\ldots, n_{m_2\\centerdot})\\) be the row margin total, \\((n_{\\centerdot m_1}, \\ldots, n_{\\centerdot m_2})\\) be the column margin total and \\(n=\\sum_{s,t} n_{s,t}\\). Let \\(\\hat{\\xi}_{1s} = \\Phi^{-1}((n_{m_1}+\\cdots+n_{s\\centerdot})/n)\\) for \\(s=m_1, \\ldots, m_2\\) be a cutpoint and similarly for \\(\\hat{\\xi}_{2t}\\). The polychoric correlationA technique for estimating the correlation between two theorised normally distributed continuous latent variables, from two observed ordinal variables, based on a two-step estimation procedure, is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\begin{array}{cr} \\hat{\\rho_N} &amp;=\\text{argmax}_{\\rho} \\sum_{s=m_1}^{m_2} \\sum_{t=m_1}^{m_2} n_{st} \\log\\left\\{ \\Phi_2(\\hat{\\xi}_{1s}, \\hat{\\xi}_{2t};\\rho) -\\Phi_2(\\hat{\\xi}_{1,s-1}, \\hat{\\xi}_{2t};\\rho) \\right.\\\\ &amp; \\left. -\\Phi_2(\\hat{\\xi}_{1s}, \\hat{\\xi}_{2,t-1};\\rho) +\\Phi_2(\\hat{\\xi}_{1,s-1}, \\hat{\\xi}_{2,t-1};\\rho) \\right\\} \\end{array} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] It is called a tetrachoric correlation for binary variables. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|rr} \\hline &amp; \\text{NoClaimCredit} &amp; \\\\ \\text{AlarmCredit} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 1669 &amp; 942 \\\\ 2 &amp; 121 &amp; 118 \\\\ 3 &amp; 195 &amp; 132 \\\\ 4 &amp; 1801 &amp; 661 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}} \\] Table 14.4 : Two-way table of counts for AlarmCredit and NoClaimCredit variables from LGPIF data. You can obtain the polychoric or tetrachoric correlation using the polychoric() or tetrachoric() function from the psych library in R. The polychoric correlation is illustrated using Table 14.4. \\(\\hat{\\rho}_N=-0.14\\), which means that there is a negative relationship between AlarmCredit and NoClaimCredit.

For example, drivers age group variable is an interval variable. For measuring association, both the continuous variable and ordinal variable approaches make sense. The former takes advantage of knowledge of the ordering although assumes continuity. The latter does not rely on the continuity but also does not make use of the information given by the distance between scales. 14.2.6 Discrete and Continuous Variables The polyserial correlationThe correlation between two continuous variables with a bivariate normal distribution, where one variable is observed directly, and the other is unobserved is defined similarly, when one variable (\\(y_1\\)) is continuous and the other (\\(y_2\\)) ordinal. Define \\(z\\) to be the normal scoreTransformed data which closely resemble a standard normal distribution of \\(y_1\\). The polyserial correlation is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{\\rho_N} = \\text{argmax}_{\\rho} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log\\left\\{ \\phi(z_{i1})\\left[ \\Phi(\\frac{\\hat{\\xi}_{2,y_{i2}} - \\rho z_{i1}} {(1-\\rho^2)^{1/2}}) -\\Phi(\\frac{\\hat{\\xi}_{2,y_{i2-1}} - \\rho z_{i1}} {(1-\\rho^2)^{1/2}}) \\right] \\right\\} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The biserial correlationA correlation coefficient used when one variable is dichotomous is defined similarly, when one variable is continuous and the other binary. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|r|r} \\hline \\text{NoClaimCredit} &amp; \\text{Mean} &amp;\\text{Total} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Claim} &amp;\\text{Claim} \\\\ \\hline 0 &amp; 22,505 &amp; 85,200,483 \\\\ 1 &amp; 6,629 &amp; 12,282,618 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}} \\] Table 14.5 : Summary of Claim by NoClaimCredit variable from LGPIF data.

In this section, you learn how to: Describe a multivariate distribution function in terms of a copula function. A copulaA multivariate distribution function with uniform marginals is a multivariate distribution function with uniform marginals. Specifically, let \\(U_1, \\ldots, U_p\\) be \\(p\\) uniform random variables on \\((0,1)\\). Their distribution function \\[{C}(u_1, \\ldots, u_p) = \\Pr(U_1 \\leq u_1, \\ldots, U_p \\leq u_p),\\] is a copula. We seek to use copulas in applications that are based on more than just uniformly distributed data. Thus, consider arbitrary marginal distribution functions \\({F}_1(y_1)\\),…,\\({F}_p(y_p)\\). Then, we can define a multivariate distribution function using the copula such that \\[{F}(y_1, \\ldots, y_p)= {C}({F}_1(y_1), \\ldots, {F}_p(y_p)).\\] Here, \\(F\\) is a multivariate distribution function in this equation. Sklar (1959) showed that \\(any\\) multivariate distribution function \\(F\\), can be written in the form of this equation, that is, using a copula representation. Sklar also showed that, if the marginal distributions are continuous, then there is a unique copula representation. In this chapter we focus on copula modeling with continuous variables. For discrete case, readers can see (Joe 2014) and (Genest and Nešlohva 2007). For bivariate case, \\(p=2\\) , the distribution function of two random variables can be written by the bivariate copula function: \\[{C}(u_1, \\, u_2) = \\Pr(U_1 \\leq u_1, \\, U_2 \\leq u_2),\\] \\[{F}(y_1, \\, y_2)= {C}({F}_1(y_1), \\, {F}_p(y_2)).\\] To give an example for bivariate copula, we can look at Frank’s (1979) copula. The equation is \\[{C}(u_1,u_2) = \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\ln \\left( 1+ \\frac{ (\\exp(\\theta u_1) -1)(\\exp(\\theta u_2) -1)} {\\exp(\\theta) -1} \\right).\\] This is a bivariate distribution function with its domain on the unit square \\([0,1]^2.\\) Here \\(\\theta\\) is dependence parameter and the range of dependence is controlled by the parameter \\(\\theta\\). Positive association increases as \\(\\theta\\) increases and this positive association can be summarized with Spearman’s rhoA nonparametric measure of rank correlation (\\(\\rho\\)) and Kendall’s tau (\\(\\tau\\)). Frank’s copula is one of the commonly used copula functions in the copula literature. We will see other copula functions in Section 14.5. Show Quiz Solution 14.4 Application Using Copulas In this section, you learn how to: Discover dependence structure between random variables Model the dependence with a copula function This section analyzes the insurance losses and expenses data with the statistical programming R. This data set was introduced in (Frees and Valdez 1998) and is now readily available in the copula package. The model fitting process is started by marginal modeling of two variables (\\(loss\\) and \\(expense\\)). Then we model the joint distribution of these marginal outcomes. 14.4.1 Data Description We start with getting a sample (\\(n = 1500\\)) from the whole data. We consider first two variables of the data; losses and expenses. losses : general liability claims from Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) expenses : ALAE, specifically attributable to the settlement of individual claims (e.g. lawyer’s fees, claims investigation expenses) To visualize the relationship between losses and expenses (ALAE), scatterplots in figure ?? are created on the real dollar scale and on the log scale. R Code for Scatterplots library(copula) data(loss) # loss data Lossdata &lt;- loss attach(Lossdata) loss &lt;- Lossdata$loss par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) plot(loss,alae, cex=.5) # real dollar scale plot(log(loss),log(alae),cex=.5) # log scale par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) 14.4.2 Marginal Models We first examine the marginal distributionsThe probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset of a collection of random variables of losses and expenses before going through the joint modeling. The histograms show that both losses and expenses are right-skewed and fat-tailedA fat-tailed distribution is a probability distribution that exhibits a large skewness or kurtosis, relative to that of either a normal distribution or an exponential distribution. For marginal distributions of losses and expenses, we consider a Pareto-type distribution, namely a Pareto type II with distribution function \\[ F(y)=1- \\left( 1 + \\frac{y}{\\theta} \\right) ^{-\\alpha},\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the scale parameter and \\(\\alpha\\) is the shape parameter. The marginal distributions of losses and expenses are fitted with maximum likelihood. Specifically, we use the \\(vglm\\) function from the R VGAM package. Firstly, we fit the marginal distribution of expenses . R Code for Pareto Fitting library(VGAM) fit = vglm(alae ~ 1, paretoII(location=0, lscale=&quot;loge&quot;, lshape=&quot;loge&quot;)) # fit the model by vlgm function coef(fit, matrix=TRUE) # extract fitted model coefficients, matrix=TRUE gives logarithm of estimated parameters instead of default normal scale estimates Coef(fit) Output: loge(scale) loge(shape) (Intercept) 9.624673 0.7988753 scale shape (Intercept) 15133.603598 2.223039 We repeat this procedure to fit the marginal distribution of the loss variable. Because the loss data also seems right-skewed and heavy-tail data, we also model the marginal distribution with Pareto II distribution. R Code for Pareto Fitting fitloss = vglm(loss ~ 1, paretoII, trace=TRUE) Coef(fit) summary(fit) Output: scale shape 15133.603598 2.223039 To visualize the fitted distribution of expenses and loss variables, we use the estimated parameters and plot the corresponding distribution function and density function. For more details on marginal model selection, see Chapter 4. 14.4.3 Probability Integral Transformation The probability integral transformationAny continuous variable can be mapped to a uniform random variable via its distribution function shows that any continuous variable can be mapped to a \\(U(0,1)\\) random variable via its distribution function. Given the fitted Pareto II distribution, the variable expenses is transformed to the variable \\(u_1\\), which follows a uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\): \\[u_1 = 1 - \\left( 1 + \\frac{ALAE}{\\hat{\\theta}} \\right)^{-\\hat{\\alpha}}.\\] After applying the probability integral transformation to expenses variable, we plot the histogram of Transformed Alae in Figure 14.2. Figure 14.2: Histogram of Transformed Alae After fitting process,the variable loss is also transformed to the variable \\(u_2\\), which follows a uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\). We plot the histogram of Transformed Loss . As an alternative, the variable loss is transformed to \\(normal\\) \\(scores\\) with the quantile function of standard normal distribution. As we see in Figure 14.3, normal scores of the variable loss are approximately marginally standard normal. Figure 14.3: Histogram of Transformed Loss.

Then we calculate the Spearman’s rho between these two uniform random variables. Figure 14.4: Left: Scatter plot for transformed variables.

It is more clear to see the relationship with normal scores in the second graph.

We use the fitted parameter to update the Frank’s copula. The Spearman’s correlation corresponding to the fitted copula parameter(3.114) is calculated with the rho function. In this case, the Spearman’s correlation coefficient is 0.462, which is very close to the sample Spearman’s correlation coefficient; 0.452.

That is: \\(\\theta=0\\): independent copula \\(\\theta&gt;0\\): positive dependence \\(\\theta&lt;0\\): negative dependence 14.5 Types of Copulas In this section, you learn how to: Define the basic families of the copula functions Calculate the association coefficients by the help of copula functions There are several families of copulas have been described in the literature. Two main families of the copula families are the Archimedian and Elliptical copulas. 14.5.1 Elliptical Copulas Elliptical copulasThe copulas of elliptical distributions are constructed from elliptical distributionsAny member of a broad family of probability distributions that generalize the multivariate normal distribution. This copula decompose (multivariate) elliptical distributions into their univariate elliptical marginal distributions by Sklar’s theorem (Hofert et al. 2018). Properties of elliptical copulas are typically obtained from the properties of corresponding elliptical distributions (Hofert et al. 2018). For example, the normal distribution is a special type of elliptical distribution. To introduce the elliptical class of copulas, we start with the familiar multivariate normal distribution with probability density function \\[\\phi_N (\\mathbf{z})= \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{p/2}\\sqrt{\\det \\boldsymbol \\Sigma}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{z}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\Sigma^{-1}\\mathbf{z}\\right).\\] Here, \\(\\boldsymbol \\Sigma\\) is a correlation matrixA table showing correlation coefficients between variables, with ones on the diagonal. Let \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\phi\\) denote the standard normal distribution and density functions. We define the Gaussian (normal) copula density function as \\[{c}_N(u_1, \\ldots, u_p) = \\phi_N \\left(\\Phi^{-1}(u_1), \\ldots, \\Phi^{-1}(u_p) \\right) \\prod_{j=1}^p \\frac{1}{\\phi(\\Phi^{-1}(u_j))}.\\] As with other copulas, the domain is the unit cube \\([0,1]^p\\). Specifically, a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector \\({z}\\) has an \\({elliptical}\\) \\({distribution}\\) if the density can be written as \\[h_E (\\mathbf{z})= \\frac{k_p}{\\sqrt{\\det \\boldsymbol \\Sigma}} g_p \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{z}- \\boldsymbol \\mu)^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\Sigma^{-1}(\\mathbf{z}- \\boldsymbol \\mu) \\right).\\] We will use elliptical distributions to generate copulas. Because copulas are concerned primarily with relationships, we may restrict our considerations to the case where \\(\\mu = \\mathbf{0}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\Sigma\\) is a correlation matrix. With these restrictions, the marginal distributions of the multivariate elliptical copula are identical; we use \\(H\\) to refer to this marginal distribution function and \\(h\\) is the corresponding density. This marginal density is \\(h(z) = k_1 g_1(z^2/2).\\) We are now ready to define the \\(elliptical\\) \\(copula\\), a function defined on the unit cube \\([0,1]^p\\) as \\[{c}_E(u_1, \\ldots, u_p) = h_E \\left(H^{-1}(u_1), \\ldots, H^{-1}(u_p) \\right) \\prod_{j=1}^p \\frac{1}{h(H^{-1}(u_j))}.\\] In the elliptical copula family, the function \\(g_p\\) is known as a generator in that it can be used to generate alternative distributions. \\[ \\small\\begin{array}{lc} \\hline &amp; Generator \\\\ Distribution &amp; \\mathrm{g}_p(x) \\\\ \\hline \\text{Normal distribution} &amp; e^{-x}\\\\ \\text{t-distribution with r degrees of freedom} &amp; (1+2x/r)^{-(p+r)/2}\\\\ \\text{Cauchy} &amp; (1+2x)^{-(p+1)/2}\\\\ \\text{Logistic} &amp; e^{-x}/(1+e^{-x})^2\\\\ \\text{Exponential power} &amp; \\exp(-rx^s)\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Table 14.6 : Distribution and Generator Functions (\\(\\mathrm{g}_p(x)\\)) for Selected Elliptical Copulas Most empirical work focuses on the normal copula and \\(t\\)-copula. That is, \\(t\\)-copulas are useful for modeling the dependency in the tails of bivariate distributions, especially in financial risk analysis applications. The \\(t\\)-copulas with same association parameter in varying the degrees of freedom parameter show us different tail dependency structures. For more information on about \\(t\\)-copulas readers can see (Joe 2014), (Hofert et al. 2018). 14.5.2 Archimedian Copulas This class of copulas are constructed from a \\(generator\\) function,which is \\(\\mathrm{g}(\\cdot)\\) is a convex, decreasing function with domain [0,1] and range \\([0, \\infty)\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{g}(0)=0\\). Use \\(\\mathrm{g}^{-1}\\) for the inverse function of \\(\\mathrm{g}\\). Then the function \\[\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{g}}(u_1, \\ldots, u_p) = \\mathrm{g}^{-1} \\left(\\mathrm{g}(u_1)+ \\cdots + \\mathrm{g}(u_p) \\right)\\] is said to be an Archimedean copula. The function \\(\\mathrm{g}\\) is known as the generator of the copula \\(\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{g}}\\). For bivariate case; \\(p=2\\) , Archimedean copula function can be written by the function \\[\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{g}}(u_1, \\, u_2) = \\mathrm{g}^{-1} \\left(\\mathrm{g}(u_1) + \\mathrm{g}(u_2) \\right).\\] Some important special cases of Archimedean copulas are Frank copula, Clayton/Cook-Johnson copula, Gumbel/Hougaard copula. This copula classes are derived from different generator functions. We can remember that we mentioned about Frank’s copula with details in Section 14.3 and in Section 14.4. Here we will continue to express the equations for Clayton copula and Gumbel/Hougaard copula. 14.5.2.1 Clayton Copula For \\(p=2\\), the Clayton copula is parameterized by \\(\\theta \\in [-1,\\infty)\\) is defined by \\[C_{\\theta}^C(u)=\\max\\{u_1^{-\\theta}+u_2^{-\\theta}-1,0\\}^{1/\\theta}, \\quad u\\in[0,1]^2.\\] This is a bivariate distribution function of Clayton copula defined in unit square \\([0,1]^2.\\) The range of dependence is controlled by the parameter \\(\\theta\\) as the same as Frank copula. 14.5.2.2 Gumbel-Hougaard copula The Gumbel-Hougaarg copula is parametrized by \\(\\theta \\in [1,\\infty)\\) and defined by \\[C_{\\theta}^{GH}(u)=\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^2 (-\\log u_i)^{\\theta}\\right)^{1/\\theta}\\right), \\quad u\\in[0,1]^2.\\] Readers seeking deeper background on Archimedean copulas can see Joe (2014), Frees and Valdez (1998), and Genest and Mackay (1986). 14.5.3 Properties of Copulas 14.5.3.1 Bounds on Association Like all multivariate distribution functions, copulas are bounded. The Fr\\(&#39;{e}\\)chet-Hoeffding bounds are \\[\\max( u_1 +\\cdots+ u_p + p -1, 0) \\leq \\mathrm{C}(u_1, \\ldots, u_p) \\leq \\min (u_1, \\ldots,u_p).\\] To see the right-hand side of the equation, note that \\[\\mathrm{C}(u_1,\\ldots, u_p) = \\Pr(U_1 \\leq u_1, \\ldots, U_p \\leq u_p) \\leq \\Pr(U_j \\leq u_j)\\], for \\(j=1,\\ldots,p\\). The bound is achieved when \\(U_1 = \\cdots = U_p\\). To see the left-hand side when \\(p=2\\), consider \\(U_2=1-U_1\\). In this case, if \\(1-u_2 &lt; u_1\\) then \\(\\Pr(U_1 \\leq u_1, U_2 \\leq u_2) = \\Pr ( 1-u_2 \\leq U_1 &lt; u_1) =u_1+u_2-1.\\) (Nelson 1997) The product copula is \\(\\mathrm{C}(u_1,u_2)=u_1u_2\\) is the result of assuming independence between random variables. The lower bound is achieved when the two random variables are perfectly negatively related (\\(U_2=1-U_1\\)) and the upper bound is achieved when they are perfectly positively related (\\(U_2=U_1\\)). We can see The Frechet-Hoeffding boundsBounds of multivariate distribution functions for two random variables in the Figure 14.6. Figure 14.6: Perfect Positive and Perfect negative dependence plots R Code for Frechet-Hoeffding Bounds for Two Random Variables library(copula) n&lt;-100 set.seed(1980) U&lt;-runif(n) par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) plot(cbind(U,1-U), xlab=quote(U[1]), ylab=quote(U[2]),main=&quot;Perfect Negative Dependency&quot;) # W for p=2 plot (cbind(U,U), xlab=quote(U[1]),ylab=quote(U[2]),main=&quot;Perfect Positive Dependency&quot;) #M for p=2 14.5.3.2 Measures of Association Schweizer and Wolff (1981) established that the copula accounts for all the dependence between two random variables, \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\), in the following sense. Consider m\\(_1\\) and m\\(_2\\), strictly increasing functions. Thus, the manner in which \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) “move together” is captured by the copula, regardless of the scale in which each variable is measured. Schweizer and Wolff also showed the two standard nonparametric measures of association could be expressed solely in terms of the copula function. Spearman’s correlation coefficient is given by \\[= 12 \\int \\int \\left\\{\\mathrm{C}(u,v) - uv \\right\\} du dv.\\] Kendall’s tau is given by \\[= 4 \\int \\int \\mathrm{C}(u,v)d\\mathrm{C}(u,v) - 1 .\\] For these expressions, we assume that \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) have a jointly continuous distribution function. Further, the definition of Kendall’s tau uses an independent copy of (\\(Y_1\\), \\(Y_2\\)), labeled (\\(Y_1^{\\ast}\\), \\(Y_2^{\\ast}\\)), to define the measure of “concordance.” the widely used Pearson correlation depends on the margins as well as the copula. Because it is affected by non-linear changes of scale. 14.5.3.3 Tail Dependency There are some applications in which it is useful to distinguish by the part of the distribution in which the association is strongest. For example, in insurance it is helpful to understand association among the largest losses, that is, association in the right tails of the data. To capture this type of dependency, we use the right-tail concentration function. The function is \\[R(z) = \\frac{\\Pr(U_1 &gt;z, U_2 &gt; z)}{1-z} =\\Pr(U_1 &gt; z | U_2 &gt; z) =\\frac{1 - 2z + \\mathrm{C}(z,z)}{1-z} .\\] From this equation , \\(R(z)\\) will equal to \\(z\\) under independence. Joe (1997) uses the term “upper tail dependence parameter” for \\(R = \\lim_{z \\rightarrow 1} R(z)\\). Similarly, the left-tail concentration function is \\[L(z) = \\frac{\\Pr(U_1 \\leq z, U_2 \\leq z)}{z}=\\Pr(U_1 \\leq z | U_2 \\leq z) =\\frac{ \\mathrm{C}(z,z)}{1-z}.\\] Tail dependencyA measure of their comovements in the tails of the distributions concentration function captures the probability of two random variables both catching up extreme values. We calculate the left and right tail concentration functions for four different types of copulas; Normal, Frank,Gumbel and t copula. After getting tail concentration functions for each copula, we show concentration function’s values for these four copulas in Table 14.7. As in Venter (2002), we show \\(L(z)\\) for \\(z\\leq 0.5\\) and \\(R(z)\\) for \\(z&gt;0.5\\) in the tail dependence plot in Figure 14.7. We interpret the tail dependence plot, to mean that both the Frank and Normal copula exhibit no tail dependence whereas the \\(t\\) and the Gumbel may do so. The \\(t\\) copula is symmetric in its treatment of upper and lower tails. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|rr} \\hline \\text{Copula} &amp; \\text{Lower} &amp; \\text{Upper} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Frank} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\text{Gumbel} &amp; 0 &amp; 0.74 \\\\ \\text{Normal} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\text{t} &amp; 0.10 &amp; 0.10 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}} \\] Table 14.7 : Tail concentration function values for different copulas R Code for Tail Copula Functions for Different Copulas library(copula) U1 = seq(0,0.5, by=0.002) U2 = seq(0.5,1, by=0.002) U = rbind(U1, U2) TailFunction &lt;- function(Tailcop) { lowertail &lt;- pCopula(cbind(U1,U1), Tailcop)/U1 uppertail &lt;- (1-2*U2 +pCopula(cbind(U2,U2), Tailcop))/(1-U2) jointtail &lt;- rbind(lowertail,uppertail) } Tailcop1 &lt;- archmCopula(family = &quot;frank&quot;, param= c(0.05), dim = 2) Tailcop2 &lt;- archmCopula(family = &quot;gumbel&quot;,param = 3) Tailcop3 &lt;- ellipCopula(&quot;normal&quot;, param = c(0.25),dim = 2, dispstr = &quot;un&quot;) Tailcop4 &lt;- ellipCopula(&quot;t&quot;, param = c(0.25),dim = 2, dispstr = &quot;un&quot;, df=5) jointtail1 &lt;- TailFunction(Tailcop1) jointtail2 &lt;- TailFunction(Tailcop2) jointtail3 &lt;- TailFunction(Tailcop3) jointtail4 &lt;- TailFunction(Tailcop4) tailIndex(Tailcop1) tailIndex(Tailcop2) tailIndex(Tailcop3) tailIndex(Tailcop4) Figure 14.7: Tail dependence plots R Code for Tail Dependence Plots for Different Copulas plot(U,jointtail1, cex=.2, xlim=c(0,1),ylab=&quot;Tail Dependence&quot;, ylim=c(0,1)) lines(U,jointtail2, type=&quot;p&quot;,lty=1, cex=.2) lines(U,jointtail3, type=&quot;p&quot;,lty=1, cex=.2) lines(U,jointtail4, type=&quot;p&quot;,lty=1, cex=.2) text(0.75, 0.1, &quot;Frank&quot;, cex=1.3) #1 text(0.1, 0.8, &quot;Gumbel&quot;, cex=1.3) #2 text(0.25, 0.1, &quot;normal&quot;, cex=1.3) #3 arrows(.17, 0.1, .07, 0.12,code=2, angle=20, length=0.1) text(0.9, 0.4, &quot;t with 5 df&quot;, cex=1.3) #4 Show Quiz Solution 14.6 Why is Dependence Modeling Important? Dependence Modeling is important because it enables us to understand the dependence structure by defining the relationship between variables in a dataset. In insurance, ignoring dependence modeling may not impact pricing but could lead to misestimation of required capital to cover losses. For instance, from Section 14.4 , it is seen that there was a positive relationship between Loss and Expense. This means that, if there is a large loss then we expect expenses to be large as well and ignoring this relationship could lead to misestimation of reserves. To illustrate the importance of dependence modeling, we refer you back to Portfolio Management example in Chapter 6 that assumed that the property and liability risks are independent. Here, we incorporate dependence by allowing the 4 lines of business to depend on one another through a Gaussian copula. In Table 14.8, we show that dependence affects the portfolio quantiles (\\(VaR_q\\)), although not the expect value. For instance , the \\(VaR_{0.99}\\) for total risk which is the amount of capital required to ensure, with a \\(99\\%\\) degree of certainty that the firm does not become technically insolvent is higher when we incorporate dependence. This leads to less capital being allocated when dependence is ignored and can cause unexpected solvency problems. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l|rrrr} \\hline \\text{Independent} &amp;\\text{Expected} &amp; VaR_{0.9} &amp; VaR_{0.95} &amp; VaR_{0.99} \\\\ &amp;\\text{Value} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\text{Retained} &amp; 269 &amp; 300 &amp; 300 &amp; 300 \\\\ \\text{Insurer} &amp; 2,274 &amp; 4,400 &amp; 6,173 &amp; 11,859 \\\\ \\text{Total} &amp; 2,543 &amp; 4,675 &amp; 6,464 &amp; 12,159 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Gaussian Copula}&amp;\\text{Expected}&amp; VaR_{0.9} &amp; VaR_{0.95} &amp; VaR_{0.99} \\\\ &amp;\\text{Value} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\text{Retained} &amp; 269 &amp; 300 &amp; 300 &amp; 300 \\\\ \\text{Insurer} &amp; 2,340 &amp; 4,988 &amp; 7,339 &amp; 14,905 \\\\ \\text{Total} &amp; 2,609 &amp; 5,288 &amp; 7,639 &amp; 15,205 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{matrix}} \\] Table 14.8 : Results for portfolio expected value and quantiles (\\(VaR_q\\)) R Code for Simulation Using Gaussian Copula # For the gamma distributions, use alpha1 &lt;- 2; theta1 &lt;- 100 alpha2 &lt;- 2; theta2 &lt;- 200 # For the Pareto distributions, use alpha3 &lt;- 2; theta3 &lt;- 1000 alpha4 &lt;- 3; theta4 &lt;- 2000 # Deductibles d1 &lt;- 100 d2 &lt;- 200 # Simulate the risks nSim &lt;- 10000 #number of simulations set.seed(2017) #set seed to reproduce work X1 &lt;- rgamma(nSim,alpha1,scale = theta1) X2 &lt;- rgamma(nSim,alpha2,scale = theta2) # For the Pareto Distribution, use library(VGAM) X3 &lt;- rparetoII(nSim,scale=theta3,shape=alpha3) X4 &lt;- rparetoII(nSim,scale=theta4,shape=alpha4) # Portfolio Risks S &lt;- X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 Sretained &lt;- pmin(X1,d1) + pmin(X2,d2) Sinsurer &lt;- S - Sretained # Expected Claim Amounts ExpVec &lt;- t(as.matrix(c(mean(Sretained),mean(Sinsurer),mean(S)))) colnames(ExpVec) &lt;- c(&quot;Retained&quot;, &quot;Insurer&quot;,&quot;Total&quot;) round(ExpVec,digits=2) # Quantiles quantMat &lt;- rbind( quantile(Sretained, probs=c(0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99)), quantile(Sinsurer, probs=c(0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99)), quantile(S , probs=c(0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99))) rownames(quantMat) &lt;- c(&quot;Retained&quot;, &quot;Insurer&quot;,&quot;Total&quot;) round(quantMat,digits=2) plot(density(S), main=&quot;Density of Total Portfolio Risk S&quot;, xlab=&quot;S&quot;) ### Normal Copula ## library(VGAM) library(copula) library(GB2) library(statmod) library(numDeriv) set.seed(2017) parm&lt;-c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5) nc &lt;- normalCopula(parm, dim = 4, dispstr = &quot;un&quot;) mcc &lt;- mvdc(nc, margins = c(&quot;gamma&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;,&quot;paretoII&quot;,&quot;paretoII&quot;), paramMargins = list(list(scale = theta1, shape=alpha1), list(scale = theta2, shape=alpha2), list(scale = theta3, shape=alpha3), list(scale = theta4, shape=alpha4))) X &lt;- rMvdc(nSim, mvdc = mcc) X1&lt;-X[,1] X2&lt;-X[,2] X3&lt;-X[,3] X4&lt;-X[,4] # Portfolio Risks S &lt;- X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 Sretained &lt;- pmin(X1,d1) + pmin(X2,d2) Sinsurer &lt;- S - Sretained # Expected Claim Amounts ExpVec &lt;- t(as.matrix(c(mean(Sretained),mean(Sinsurer),mean(S)))) colnames(ExpVec) &lt;- c(&quot;Retained&quot;, &quot;Insurer&quot;,&quot;Total&quot;) round(ExpVec,digits=2) # Quantiles quantMat &lt;- rbind( quantile(Sretained, probs=c(0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99)), quantile(Sinsurer, probs=c(0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99)), quantile(S , probs=c(0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99))) rownames(quantMat) &lt;- c(&quot;Retained&quot;, &quot;Insurer&quot;,&quot;Total&quot;) round(quantMat,digits=2) plot(density(S), main=&quot;Density of Total Portfolio Risk S&quot;, xlab=&quot;S&quot;) Show Quiz Solution 14.7 Further Resources and Contributors Contributors Edward W.

Email: jfrees@bus.wisc.edu for chapter comments and suggested improvements. TS 14.A. Other Classic Measures of Scalar Associations TS 14.A.1. Blomqvist’s Beta Blomqvist (1950) developed a measure of dependence now known as Blomqvist’s beta, also called the median concordance coefficient and the medial correlation coefficient. Using distribution functions, this parameter can be expressed as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\beta = 4F\\left(F^{-1}_X(1/2),F^{-1}_Y(1/2) \\right) - 1. \\end{equation*}\\] That is, first evaluate each marginal at its median (\\(F^{-1}_X(1/2)\\) and \\(F^{-1}_Y(1/2)\\), respectively). Then, evaluate the bivariate distribution function at the two medians. After rescaling (multiplying by 4 and subtracting 1), the coefficient turns out to have a range of \\([-1,1]\\), where 0 occurs under independence. Like Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau, an estimator based on ranks is easy to provide. First write \\(\\beta = 4C(1/2,1/2)-1 = 2\\Pr((U_1-1/2)(U_2-1/2))-1\\) where \\(U_1, U_2\\) are uniform random variables. Then, define \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n I\\left( (R(X_{i})-\\frac{n+1}{2})(R(Y_{i})-\\frac{n+1}{2}) \\ge 0 \\right)-1 . \\end{equation*}\\] See, for example, (Joe 2014), page 57 or (Hougaard 2000), page 135, for more details. Because Blomqvist’s parameter is based on the center of the distribution, it is particularly useful when data are censored; in this case, information in extreme parts of the distribution are not always reliable. How does this affect a choice of association measures? First, recall that association measures are based on a bivariate distribution function. So, if one has knowledge of a good approximation of the distribution function, then calculation of an association measure is straightforward in principle. Second, for censored data, bivariate extensions of the univariate Kaplan-Meier distribution function estimator are available. For example, the version introduced in (Dabrowska 1988) is appealing. However, because of instances when large masses of data appear at the upper range of the data, this and other estimators of the bivariate distribution function are unreliable. This means that, summary measures of the estimated distribution function based on Spearman’s rho or Kendall’s tau can be unreliable. For this situation, Blomqvist’s beta appears to be a better choice as it focuses on the center of the distribution. (Hougaard 2000), Chapter 14, provides additional discussion.

TS 14.A.2. Nonparametric Approach Using Spearman Correlation with Tied Ranks For the first variable, the average rank of observations in the \\(s\\)th row is \\[\\begin{equation*} r_{1s} = n_{m_1\\centerdot}+ \\cdots+ n_{s-1,\\centerdot}+ \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1+ n_{s\\centerdot}\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] and similarly \\(r_{2t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[(n_{\\centerdot m_1}+ \\cdots+ n_{\\centerdot,s-1}+1)+ (n_{\\centerdot m_1}+ \\cdots+ n_{\\centerdot s})\\right]\\). With this, we have Spearman’s rho with tied rank is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\hat{\\rho}_S = \\frac{\\sum_{s=m_1}^{m_2} \\sum_{t=m_1}^{m_2} n_{st}(r_{1s} - \\bar{r})(r_{2t} - \\bar{r})} {\\left[\\sum_{s=m_1}^{m_2}n_{s \\centerdot}(r_{1s} - \\bar{r})^2 \\sum_{t=m_1}^{m_2} n_{\\centerdot t}(r_{2t} - \\bar{r})^2 \\right]^2} \\end{equation*}\\] where the average rank is \\(\\bar{r} = (n+1)/2\\). Click to Show Proof for Special Case: Binary Data. Special Case: Binary Data. Here, \\(m_1=0\\) and \\(m_2=1\\). For the first variable ranks, we have \\(r_{10} = (1+n_{0\\centerdot})/2\\) and \\(r_{11} = (n_{0\\centerdot}+1+n)/2\\). Thus, \\(r_{10} -\\bar{r}= (n_{0\\centerdot}-n)/2\\) and \\(r_{11}-\\bar{r} = n_{0\\centerdot}/2\\). This means that we have \\(\\sum_{s=0}^{1}n_{s\\centerdot}(r_{1s} - \\bar{r})^2 = n (n-n_{0\\centerdot})n_{0\\centerdot}/4\\) and similarly for the second variable.

The appendix gives an overview of concepts and methods related to statistical inference on the population of interest, using a random sample of observations from the population. In the appendix, Section 15.1 introduces the basic concepts related to the population and the sample used for making the inference. Section 15.2 presents the commonly used methods for point estimation of population characteristics. Section 15.3 demonstrates interval estimation that takes into consideration the uncertainty in the estimation, due to use of a random sample from the population. Section 15.4 introduces the concept of hypothesis testing for the purpose of variable and model selection. 15.1 Basic Concepts In this section, you learn the following concepts related to statistical inference. Random sampling from a population that can be summarized using a list of items or individuals within the population Sampling distributions that characterize the distributions of possible outcomes for a statistic calculated from a random sample The central limit theorem that guides the distribution of the mean of a random sample from the population Statistical inference is the process of making conclusions on the characteristics of a large set of items/individuals (i.e., the population), using a representative set of data (e.g., a random sample) from a list of items or individuals from the population that can be sampled. While the process has a broad spectrum of applications in various areas including science, engineering, health, social, and economic fields, statistical inference is important to insurance companies that use data from their existing policy holders in order to make inference on the characteristics (e.g., risk profiles) of a specific segment of target customers (i.e., the population) whom the insurance companies do not directly observe. Show An Empirical Example Using the Wisconsin Property Fund Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. Assume there are 1,377 individual claims from the 2010 experience. Minimum First Quartile Median Mean Third Quartile Maximum Standard Deviation Claims 1 788 2,250 26,620 6,171 12,920,000 368,030 Logarithmic Claims 0 6.670 7.719 7.804 8.728 16.370 1.683 ClaimLev &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/CLAIMLEVEL.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) ClaimLevBC10&lt;-subset(ClaimLev,Year==2010); cat(&quot;Sample size: &quot;, nrow(ClaimLevBC10), &quot;\\n&quot;) par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) hist(ClaimLevBC10$Claim, main=&quot;&quot;, xlab=&quot;Claims&quot;) hist(log(ClaimLevBC10$Claim), main=&quot;&quot;, xlab=&quot;Logarithmic Claims&quot;) Figure 15.1: Distribution of Claims ## Sample size: 1377 Using the 2010 claim experience (the sample), the Wisconsin Property Fund may be interested in assessing the severity of all claims that could potentially occur, such as 2010, 2011, and so forth (the population). This process is important in the contexts of ratemaking or claim predictive modeling. In order for such inference to be valid, we need to assume that the set of 2010 claims is a random sample that is representative of the population, the sampling distribution of the average claim amount can be estimated, so that we can quantify the bias and uncertainty in the esitmation due to use of a finite sample. 15.1.1 Random Sampling In statistics, a sampling error occurs when the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is drawn, is not an adequate approximation of the population of interest. A sample must be a representative subset of a population, or universe, of interest. If the sample is not representative, taking a larger sample does not eliminate bias, as the same mistake is repeated over again and again. Thus, we introduce the concept for random sampling that gives rise to a simple random sample that is representative of the population. We assume that the random variable \\(X\\) represents a draw from a population with a distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) with mean \\(\\mathrm{E}[X]=\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}[X]=\\mathrm{E}[(X-\\mu)^2]\\), where \\(E(\\cdot)\\) denotes the expectation of a random variable. In random sampling, we make a total of \\(n\\) such draws represented by \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), each unrelated to one another (i.e., statistically independent). We refer to \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) as a random sample (with replacement) from \\(F(\\cdot)\\), taking either a parametric or nonparametric form. Alternatively, we may say that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) are identically and independently distributed (iid) with distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\). 15.1.2 Sampling Distribution Using the random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), we are interested in making a conclusion on a specific attribute of the population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). For example, we may be interested in making an inference on the population mean, denoted \\(\\mu\\). It is natural to think of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}=\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\), as an estimate of the population mean \\(\\mu\\). We call the sample mean as a statistic calculated from the random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). Other commonly used summary statistics include sample standard deviation and sample quantiles. When using a statistic (e.g., the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\)) to make statistical inference on the population attribute (e.g., population mean \\(\\mu\\)), the quality of inference is determined by the bias and uncertainty in the estimation, owing to the use of a sample in place of the population. Hence, it is important to study the distribution of a statistic that quantifies the bias and variability of the statistic. In particular, the distribution of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\) (or any other statistic), is called the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution depends on the sampling process, the statistic, the sample size \\(n\\) and the population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). The central limit theorem gives the large-sample (sampling) distribution of the sample mean under certain conditions. 15.1.3 Central Limit Theorem In statistics, there are variations of the central limit theorem (CLT) ensuring that, under certain conditions, the sample mean will approach the population mean with its sampling distribution approaching the normal distribution as the sample size goes to infinity. We give the Lindeberg–Levy CLT that establishes the asymptotic sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) calculated using a random sample from a universe population having a distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Lindeberg–Levy CLT. Let \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a random sample from a population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2&lt;\\infty\\). The difference between the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\mu\\), when multiplied by \\(\\sqrt{n}\\), converges in distribution to a normal distribution as the sample size goes to infinity. That is, \\[\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X}-\\mu)\\xrightarrow[]{d}N(0,\\sigma).\\] Note that the CLT does not require a parametric form for \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Based on the CLT, we may perform statistical inference on the population mean (we infer, not deduce). The types of inference we may perform include estimation of the population, hypothesis testing on whether a null statement is true, and prediction of future samples from the population. 15.2 Point Estimation and Properties In this section, you learn how to estimate population parameters using method of moments estimation estimate population parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation The population distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) can usually be characterized by a limited (finite) number of terms called parameters, in which case we refer to the distribution as a parametric distribution. In contrast, in nonparametric analysis, the attributes of the sampling distribution are not limited to a small number of parameters. For obtaining the population characteristics, there are different attributes related to the population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Such measures include the mean, median, percentiles (i.e., 95th percentile), and standard deviation. Because these summary measures do not depend on a specific parametric reference, they are nonparametric summary measures. In parametric analysis, on the other hand, we may assume specific families of distributions with specific parameters. For example, people usually think of logarithm of claim amounts to be normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). That is, we assume that the claims have a lognormal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Alternatively, insurance companies commonly assume that claim severity follows a gamma distribution with a shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and a scale parameter \\(\\theta\\). Here, the normal, lognormal, and gamma distributions are examples of parametric distributions. In the above examples, the quantities of \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\theta\\) are known as parameters. For a given parametric distribution family, the distribution is uniquely determined by the values of the parameters. One often uses \\(\\theta\\) to denote a summary attribute of the population. In parametric models, \\(\\theta\\) can be a parameter or a function of parameters from a distribution such as the normal mean and variance parameters. In nonparametric analysis, it can take a form of a nonparametric summary such as the population mean or standard deviation. Let \\(\\hat{\\theta} =\\hat{\\theta}(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)\\) be a function of the sample that provides a proxy, or an estimate, of \\(\\theta\\). It is referred to as a statistic, a function of the sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. The sample mean 7.804 and the sample standard deviation 1.683 can be either deemed as nonparametric estimates of the population mean and standard deviation, or as parametric estimates of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) of the normal distribution concerning the logarithmic claims. Using results from the lognormal distribution, we may estimate the expected claim, the lognormal mean, as 10,106.8 ( \\(=\\exp(7.804+1.683^2/2)\\) ). For the Wisconsin Property Fund data, we may denote \\(\\hat{\\mu} =7.804\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma} = 1.683\\), with the hat notation denoting an estimate of the parameter based on the sample. In particular, such an estimate is referred to as a point estimate, a single approximation of the corresponding parameter. For point estimation, we introduce the two commonly used methods called the method of moments estimation and maximum likelihood estimation. 15.2.1 Method of Moments Estimation Before defining the method of moments estimation, we define the the concept of moments. Moments are population attributes that characterize the distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Given a random draw \\(X\\) from \\(F(\\cdot)\\), the expectation \\(\\mu_k=\\mathrm{E}[X^k]\\) is called the \\(k\\)th moment of \\(X\\), \\(k=1,2,3,\\ldots\\) For example, the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is the first moment. Furthermore, the expectation \\(\\mathrm{E}[(X-\\mu)^k]\\) is called a \\(k\\)th central moment. Thus, the variance is the second central moment. Using the random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), we may construct the corresponding sample moment, \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^k\\), for estimating the population attribute \\(\\mu_k\\). For example, we have used the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) as an estimator for the population mean \\(\\mu\\). Similarly, the second central moment can be estimated as \\((1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2\\). Without assuming a parametric form for \\(F(\\cdot)\\), the sample moments constitute nonparametric estimates of the corresponding population attributes. Such an estimator based on matching of the corresponding sample and population moments is called a method of moments estimator (MME). While the MME works naturally in a nonparametric model, it can be used to estimate parameters when a specific parametric family of distribution is assumed for \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Denote by \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\theta_1,\\cdots,\\theta_m)\\) the vector of parameters corresponding to a parametric distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Given a distribution family, we commonly know the relationships between the parameters and the moments. In particular, we know the specific forms of the functions \\(h_1(\\cdot),h_2(\\cdot),\\cdots,h_m(\\cdot)\\) such that \\(\\mu_1=h_1(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\,\\mu_2=h_2(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\,\\cdots,\\,\\mu_m=h_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\). Given the MME \\(\\hat{\\mu}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{\\mu}_m\\) from the random sample, the MME of the parameters \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m\\) can be obtained by solving the equations of \\[\\hat{\\mu}_1=h_1(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m);\\] \\[\\hat{\\mu}_2=h_2(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m);\\] \\[\\cdots\\] \\[\\hat{\\mu}_m=h_m(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m).\\] Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. Assume that the claims follow a lognormal distribution, so that logarithmic claims follow a normal distribution. Specifically, assume \\(\\ln(X)\\) has a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), denoted as \\(\\ln(X) \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). It is straightforward that the MME \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}=\\sqrt{(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2}\\). For the Wisconsin Property Fund example, the method of moments estimates are \\(\\hat{\\mu} =7.804\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma} = 1.683\\). 15.2.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation When \\(F(\\cdot)\\) takes a parametric form, the maximum likelihood method is widely used for estimating the population parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). Maximum likelihood estimation is based on the likelihood function, a function of the parameters given the observed sample. Denote by \\(f(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) the probability function of \\(X_i\\) evaluated at \\(X_i=x_i\\) \\((i=1,2,\\cdots,n)\\); it is the probability mass function in the case of a discrete \\(X\\) and the probability density function in the case of a continuous \\(X\\). Assuming independence, the likelihood function of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) associated with the observation \\((X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n)=(x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)=\\mathbf{x}\\) can be written as \\[L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^nf(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\] with the corresponding log-likelihood function given by \\[l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\ln(L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x}))=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\ln f(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}).\\] The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) is the set of values of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) that maximize the likelihood function (log-likelihood function), given the observed sample. That is, the MLE \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\) can be written as \\[\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}={\\mbox{argmax}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\in\\Theta}l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x}),\\] where \\(\\Theta\\) is the parameter space of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), and \\({\\mbox{argmax}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\in\\Theta}l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})\\) is defined as the value of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) at which the function \\(l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})\\) reachs its maximum. Given the analytical form of the likelihood function, the MLE can be obtained by taking the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), and setting the values of the partial derivatives to zero. That is, the MLE are the solutions of the equations of \\[\\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\theta}_1}=0;\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\theta}_2}=0;\\] \\[\\cdots\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\theta}_m}=0,\\] provided that the second partial derivatives are negative. For parametric models, the MLE of the parameters can be obtained either analytically (e.g., in the case of normal distributions and linear estimators), or numerically through iterative algorithms such as the Newton-Raphson method and its adaptive versions (e.g., in the case of generalized linear models with a non-normal response variable). Normal distribution. Assume \\((X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n)\\) to be a random sample from the normal distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). With an observed sample \\((X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n)=(x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)\\), we can write the likelihood function of \\(\\mu,\\sigma^2\\) as \\[L(\\mu,\\sigma^2)=\\prod_{i=1}^n\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\right],\\] with the corresponding log-likelihood function given by \\[l(\\mu,\\sigma^2)=-\\frac{n}{2}[\\ln(2\\pi)+\\ln(\\sigma^2)]-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)^2.\\] By solving \\[\\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\mu},\\sigma^2)}{\\partial \\hat{\\mu}}=0,\\] we obtain \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{x}=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i\\). It is straightforward to verify that \\(\\frac{\\partial l^2(\\hat{\\mu},\\sigma^2)}{\\partial \\hat{\\mu}^2}\\left|_{\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{x}}\\right.&lt;0\\). Since this works for arbitrary \\(x\\), \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{X}\\) is the MLE of \\(\\mu\\). Similarly, by solving \\[\\frac{\\partial l(\\mu,\\hat{\\sigma}^2)}{\\partial \\hat{\\sigma}^2}=0,\\] we obtain \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\mu)^2\\). Further replacing \\(\\mu\\) by \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\), we derive the MLE of \\(\\sigma^2\\) as \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2\\). Hence, the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) are both the MME and MLEMaximum likelihood estimate for the mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), under a normal population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). More details regarding the properties of the likelihood function, and the derivation of MLE under parametric distributions other than the normal distribution are given in Appendix Chapter 16. 15.3 Interval Estimation In this section, you learn how to derive the exact sampling distribution of the MLE of the normal mean obtain the large-sample approximation of the sampling distribution using the large sample properties of the MLE construct a confidence interval of a parameter based on the large sample properties of the MLE Now that we have introduced the MME and MLE, we may perform the first type of statistical inference, interval estimation that quantifies the uncertainty resulting from the use of a finite sample. By deriving the sampling distribution of MLE, we can estimate an interval (a confidence interval) for the parameter. Under the frequentist approach (e.g., that based on maximum likelihood estimation), the confidence intervals generated from the same random sampling frame will cover the true value the majority of times (e.g., 95% of the times), if we repeat the sampling process and re-calculate the interval over and over again. Such a process requires the derivation of the sampling distribution for the MLE. 15.3.1 Exact Distribution for Normal Sample Mean Due to the additivity property of the normal distribution (i.e., a sum of normal random variables that follows a multivariate normal distribution still follows a normal distribution) and that the normal distribution belongs to the location–scale family (i.e., a location and/or scale transformation of a normal random variable has a normal distribution), the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) of a random sample from a normal \\(F(\\cdot)\\) has a normal sampling distribution for any finite \\(n\\). Given \\(X_i\\sim^{iid} N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\), the MLE of \\(\\mu\\) has an exact distribution \\[\\bar{X}\\sim N\\left(\\mu,\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right).\\] Hence, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\mu\\). In addition, the uncertainty in the estimation can be quantified by its variance \\(\\sigma^2/n\\), that decreases with the sample size \\(n\\). When the sample size goes to infinity, the sample mean will approach a single mass at the true value. 15.3.2 Large-sample Properties of MLE For the MLE of the mean parameter and any other parameters of other parametric distribution families, however, we usually cannot derive an exact sampling distribution for finite samples. Fortunately, when the sample size is sufficiently large, MLEs can be approximated by a normal distribution. Due to the general maximum likelihood theory, the MLE has some nice large-sample properties. The MLE \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) of a parameter \\(\\theta\\), is a consistent estimator. That is, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) converges in probability to the true value \\(\\theta\\), as the sample size \\(n\\) goes to infinity. The MLE has the asymptotic normality property, meaning that the estimator will converge in distribution to a normal distribution centered around the true value, when the sample size goes to infinity. Namely, \\[\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta)\\rightarrow_d N\\left(0,\\,V\\right),\\quad \\mbox{as}\\quad n\\rightarrow \\infty,\\] where \\(V\\) is the inverse of the Fisher Information. Hence, the MLE \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) approximately follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(V/n\\), when the sample size is large. The MLE is efficient, meaning that it has the smallest asymptotic variance \\(V\\), commonly referred to as the Cramer–Rao lower bound. In particular, the Cramer–Rao lower bound is the inverse of the Fisher information defined as \\(\\mathcal{I}(\\theta)=-\\mathrm{E}(\\partial^2\\ln f(X;\\theta)/\\partial \\theta^2)\\). Hence, \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})\\) can be estimated based on the observed Fisher information that can be written as \\(-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\partial^2\\ln f(X_i;\\theta)/\\partial \\theta^2\\). For many parametric distributions, the Fisher information may be derived analytically for the MLE of parameters. For more sophisticated parametric models, the Fisher information can be evaluated numerically using numerical integration for continuous distributions, or numerical summation for discrete distributions. 15.3.3 Confidence Interval Given that the MLE \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) has either an exact or an approximate normal distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})\\), we may take the square root of the variance and plug-in the estimate to define \\(se(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})}\\). A standard error is an estimated standard deviation that quantifies the uncertainty in the estimation resulting from the use of a finite sample. Under some regularity conditions governing the population distribution, we may establish that the statistic \\[\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta}{se(\\hat{\\theta})}\\] converges in distribution to a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom (a parameter of the distribution) \\({n-p}\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of parameters in the model other than the variance. For example, for the normal distribution case, we have \\(p=1\\) for the parameter \\(\\mu\\); for a linear regression model with an independent variable, we have \\(p=2\\) for the parameters of the intercept and the independent variable. Denote by \\(t_{n-p}(1-\\alpha/2)\\) the \\(100\\times(1-\\alpha/2)\\)-th percentile of the Student-\\(t\\) distribution that satisfies \\(\\Pr\\left[t&lt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\right) \\right]= 1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\). We have, \\[\\Pr\\left[-t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)&lt;\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta}{se(\\hat{\\theta})}&lt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right]= 1-{\\alpha},\\] from which we can derive a confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\). From the above equation we can derive a pair of statistics, \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}_2\\), that provide an interval of the form \\([\\hat{\\theta}_1, \\hat{\\theta}_2]\\). This interval is a \\(1-\\alpha\\) confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(\\Pr\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_1 \\le \\theta \\le \\hat{\\theta}_2\\right) = 1-\\alpha,\\) where the probability \\(1-\\alpha\\) is referred to as the confidence level. Note that the above confidence interval is not valid for small samples, except for the case of the normal mean. Normal distribution. For the normal population mean \\(\\mu\\), the MLE has an exact sampling distribution \\(\\bar{X}\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma/\\sqrt{n})\\), in which we can estimate \\(se(\\hat{\\theta})\\) by \\(\\hat{\\sigma}/\\sqrt{n}\\). Based on the Cochran’s theorem, the resulting statistic has an exact Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\). Hence, we can derive the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval as \\[\\hat{\\mu}_1 = \\hat{\\mu} - t_{n-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\frac{ \\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] and \\[\\hat{\\mu}_2 = \\hat{\\mu} + t_{n-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\frac{ \\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\] When \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), \\(t_{n-1}(1-\\alpha/2) \\approx 1.96\\) for large values of \\(n\\). Based on the Cochran’s theorem, the confidence interval is valid regardless of the sample size. Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. For the lognormal claim model, (7.715235, 7.893208) is a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\). More details regarding interval estimation based the MLE of other parameters and distribution families are given in Appendix Chapter 17. 15.4 Hypothesis Testing In this section, you learn how to understand the basic concepts in hypothesis testing including the level of significance and the power of a test perform hypothesis testing such as a Student-\\(t\\) test based on the properties of the MLE construct a likelihood ratio test for a single parameter or multiple parameters from the same statistical model use information criteria such as the Akaike’s information criterion or the Bayesian information criterion to perform model selection For the parameter(s) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) from a parametric distribution, an alternative type of statistical inference is called hypothesis tesing that verifies whether a hypothesis regarding the parameter(s) is true, under a given probability called the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\) (e.g., 5%). In hypothesis testing, we reject the null hypothesis, a restrictive statement concerning the parameter(s), if the probability of observing a random sample as extremal as the observed one is smaller than \\(\\alpha\\), if the null hypothesis were true. 15.4.1 Basic Concepts In a statistical test, we are usually interested in testing whether a statement regarding some parameter(s), a null hypothesis (denoted \\(H_0\\)), is true given the observed data. The null hypothesis can take a general form \\(H_0:\\theta\\in\\Theta_0\\), where \\(\\Theta_0\\) is a subset of the parameter space \\(\\Theta\\) of \\(\\theta\\) that may contain multiple parameters. For the case with a single parameter \\(\\theta\\), the null hypothesis usually takes either the form \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) or \\(H_0:\\theta\\leq\\theta_0\\). The opposite of the null hypothesis is called the alternative hypothesis that can be written as \\(H_a:\\theta\\neq\\theta_0\\) or \\(H_a:\\theta&gt;\\theta_0\\). The statistical test on \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) is called a two-sided as the alternative hypothesis contains two ineqalities of \\(H_a:\\theta&lt;\\theta_0\\) or \\(\\theta&gt;\\theta_0\\). In contrast, the statistical test on either \\(H_0:\\theta\\leq\\theta_0\\) or \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\) is called a one-sided test. A statistical test is usually constructed based on a statistic \\(T\\) and its exact or large-sample distribution. The test typically rejects a two-sided test when either \\(T &gt; c_1\\) or \\(T &lt; c_2\\), where the two constants \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) are obtained based on the sampling distribution of \\(T\\) at a probability level \\(\\alpha\\) called the level of significance. In particular, the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\) satisfies \\[\\alpha=\\Pr(\\mbox{reject }H_0|H_0\\mbox{ is true}),\\] meaning that if the null hypothesis were true, we would reject the null hypothesis only 5% of the times, if we repeat the sampling process and perform the test over and over again. Thus, the level of significance is the probability of making a type I error (error of the first kind), the error of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis. For this reason, the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\) is also referred to as the type I error rate. Another type of error we may make in hypothesis testing is the type II error (error of the second kind), the error of incorrectly accepting a false null hypothesis. Similarly, we can define the type II error rate as the probability of not rejecting (accepting) a null hypothesis given that it is not true. That is, the type II error rate is given by \\[\\Pr(\\mbox{accept }H_0|H_0\\mbox{ is false}).\\] Another important quantity concerning the quality of the statistical test is called the power of the test \\(\\beta\\), defined as the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. The mathematical definition of the power is \\[\\beta=\\Pr(\\mbox{reject }H_0|H_0\\mbox{ is false}).\\] Note that the power of the test is typically calculated based on a specific alternative value of \\(\\theta=\\theta_a\\), given a specific sampling distribution and a given sample size. In real experimental studies, people usually calculate the required sample size in order to choose a sample size that will ensure a large chance of obtaining a statistically significant test (i.e., with a prespecified statistical power such as 85%). 15.4.2 Student-\\(t\\) test based on MLE Based on the results from Section 15.3.1, we can define a Student \\(t\\) test for testing \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\). In particular, we define the test statistic as \\[t\\text{-stat}=\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta_0}{se(\\hat{\\theta})},\\] which has a large-sample distribution of a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\({n-p}\\), when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., when \\(\\theta=\\theta_0\\)). For a given level of significance \\(\\alpha\\), say 5%, we reject the null hypothesis if the event \\(t\\text{-stat}&lt;-t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\right)\\) or \\(t\\text{-stat}&gt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\right)\\) occurs (the rejection region). Under the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), we have \\[\\Pr\\left[t\\text{-stat}&lt;-t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right]=\\Pr\\left[t\\text{-stat}&gt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right]= \\frac{\\alpha}{2}.\\] In addition to the concept of rejection region, we may reject the test based on the \\(p\\)-value defined as \\(2\\Pr(T&gt;|t\\text{-stat}|)\\) for the aforementioned two-sided test, where the random variable \\(T\\sim T_{n-p}\\). We reject the null hypothesis if \\(p\\)-value is smaller than and equal to \\(\\alpha\\). For a given sample, a \\(p\\)-value is defined to be the smallest significance level for which the null hypothesis would be rejected. Similarly, we can construct a one-sided test for the null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\theta\\leq\\theta_0\\) (or \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\)). Using the same test statistic, we reject the null hypothesis when \\(t\\text{-stat}&gt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}\\right)\\) (or \\(t\\text{-stat}&lt;- t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}\\right)\\) for the test on \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\)). The corresponding \\(p\\)-value is defined as \\(\\Pr(T&gt;|t\\text{-stat}|)\\) (or \\(\\Pr(T&lt;|t\\text{-stat}|)\\) for the test on \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\)). Note that the test is not valid for small samples, except for the case of the test on the normal mean. One-sample \\(t\\) Test for Normal Mean. For the test on the normal mean of the form \\(H_0:\\mu=\\mu_0\\), \\(H_0:\\mu\\leq\\mu_0\\) or \\(H_0:\\mu\\geq\\mu_0\\), we can define the test statistic as \\[t\\text{-stat}=\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_0}{{\\hat{\\sigma}}/{\\sqrt{n}}},\\] for which we have an exact sampling distribution \\(t\\text{-stat}\\sim T_{n-1}\\) from the Cochran’s theorem, with \\(T_{n-1}\\) denoting a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\). According to the Cochran’s theorem, the test is valid for both small and large samples. Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. Assume that mean logarithmic claims have historically been approximately by \\(\\mu_0 = \\ln(5000)= 8.517\\). We might want to use the 2010 data to assess whether the mean of the distribution has changed (a two-sided test), or whether it has increased (a one-sided test). Given the actual 2010 average \\(\\hat{\\mu} =7.804\\), we may use the one-sample \\(t\\) test to assess whether this is a significant departure from \\(\\mu_0 = 8.517\\) (i.e., in testing \\(H_0:\\mu=8.517\\)). The test statistic \\(t\\text{-stat}=(8.517-7.804)/(1.683/\\sqrt{1377}) = 15.72&gt;t_{1376}\\left(0.975\\right)\\). Hence, we reject the two-sided test at \\(\\alpha=5\\%\\). Similarly, we will reject the one-sided test at \\(\\alpha=5\\%\\). Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. For numerical stability and extensions to regression applications, statistical packages often work with transformed versions of parameters. The following estimates are from the R package VGAM (the function). More details on the MLE of other distribution families are given in Appendix Chapter 17.

In this section, we define an alternative test called the likelihood ratio test (LRT). The LRT may be used to test multiple parameters from the same statistical model. Given the likelihood function \\(L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})\\) and \\(\\Theta_0 \\subset \\Theta\\), the likelihood ratio test statistic for testing \\(H_0:\\theta\\in\\Theta_0\\) against \\(H_a:\\theta\\notin\\Theta_0\\) is given by \\[L=\\frac{\\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta_0}L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta}L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})},\\] and that for testing \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) versis \\(H_a:\\theta\\neq\\theta_0\\) is \\[L=\\frac{L(\\theta_0|\\mathbf{x})}{\\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta}L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})}.\\] The LRT rejects the null hypothesis when \\(L &lt; c\\), with the threshold depending on the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\), the sample size \\(n\\), and the number of parameters in \\(\\theta\\). Based on the Neyman–Pearson Lemma, the LRT is the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test for testing \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) versis \\(H_a:\\theta=\\theta_a\\). That is, it provides the largest power \\(\\beta\\) for a given \\(\\alpha\\) and a given alternative value \\(\\theta_a\\). Based on the Wilks’s Theorem, the likelihood ratio test statistic \\(-2\\ln(L)\\) converges in distribution to a Chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom being the difference between the dimensionality of the parameter spaces \\(\\Theta\\) and \\(\\Theta_0\\), when the sample size goes to infinity and when the null model is nested within the alternative model. That is, when the null model is a special case of the alternative model containing a restricted sample space, we may approximate \\(c\\) by \\(\\chi^2_{p_1 - p_2}(1-\\alpha)\\), the \\(100\\times(1-\\alpha)\\) th percentile of the Chi-square distribution, with \\(p_1-p_2\\) being the degrees of freedom, and \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) being the numbers of parameters in the alternative and null models, respectively. Note that the LRT is also a large-sample test that will not be valid for small samples. 15.4.4 Information Criteria In real-life applications, the LRT has been commonly used for comparing two nested models. The LRT approach as a model selection tool, however, has two major drawbacks: 1) It typically requires the null model to be nested within the alternative model; 2) models selected from the LRT tends to provide in-sample over-fitting, leading to poor out-of-sample prediction. In order to overcome these issues, model selection based on information criteria, applicable to non-nested models while taking into consideration the model complexity, is more widely used for model selection. Here, we introduce the two most widely used criteria, the Akaike’s information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion. In particular, the Akaike’s information criterion (\\(AIC\\)) is defined as \\[AIC = -2\\ln L(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}) + 2p,\\] where \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\) denotes the MLE of \\({\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\), and \\(p\\) is the number of parameters in the model. The additional term \\(2 p\\) represents a penalty for the complexity of the model. That is, with the same maximized likelihood function, the \\(AIC\\) favors model with less parameters. We note that the \\(AIC\\) does not consider the impact from the sample size \\(n\\). Alternatively, people use the Bayesian information criterion (\\(BIC\\)) that takes into consideration the sample size. The \\(BIC\\) is defined as \\[BIC = -2\\ln L(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}) + p\\,\\ln(n).\\] We observe that the \\(BIC\\) generally puts a higher weight on the number of parameters. With the same maximized likelihood function, the \\(BIC\\) will suggest a more parsimonious model than the \\(AIC\\). Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. Both the \\(AIC\\) and \\(BIC\\) statistics suggest that the GB2 is the best fitting model whereas gamma is the worst.

["C-AppB.html", "Chapter 16 Appendix B: Iterated Expectations 16.1 Conditional Distribution and Conditional Expectation 16.2 Iterated Expectations and Total Variance 16.3 Conjugate Distributions", " Chapter 16 Appendix B: Iterated Expectations This appendix introduces the laws related to iterated expectations. In particular, Section 16.1 introduces the concepts of conditional distribution and conditional expectation. Section 16.2 introduces the Law of Iterated Expectations and the Law of Total Variance. In some situations, we only observe a single outcome but can conceptualize an outcome as resulting from a two (or more) stage process. Such types of statistical models are called two-stage, or hierarchical models. Some special cases of hierarchical models include: models where the parameters of the distribution are random variables; mixture distribution, where Stage 1 represents the draw of a sub-population and Stage 2 represents a random variable from a distribution that is determined by the sub-population drew in Stage 1; an aggregate distribution, where Stage 1 represents the draw of the number of events and Stage two represents the loss amount occurred per event. In these situations, the process gives rise to a conditional distribution of a random variable (the Stage 2 outcome) given the other (the Stage 1 outcome). The Law of Iterated Expectations can be useful for obtaining the unconditional expectation or variance of a random variable in such cases. 16.1 Conditional Distribution and Conditional Expectation In this section, you learn the concepts related to the conditional distribution of a random variable given another how to define the conditional expectation and variance based on the conditional distribution function The iterated expectations are the laws regarding calculation of the expectation and variance of a random variable using a conditional distribution of the variable given another variable. Hence, we first introduce the concepts related to the conditional distribution, and the calculation of the conditional expectation and variable based on a given conditional distribution. 16.1.1 Conditional Distribution Here we introduce the concept of conditional distribution respectively for discrete and continuous random variables. 16.1.1.1 Discrete Case Suppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are both discrete random variables, meaning that they can take a finite or countable number of possible values with a positive probability. The joint probability (mass) function of (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\)) is defined as \\[p(x,y) = \\Pr[X=x, Y=y]\\]. When \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent (the value of \\(X\\) does not depend on that of \\(Y\\)), we have \\[p(x,y)=p(x)p(y),\\] with \\(p(x)=\\Pr[X=x]\\) and \\(p(y)=\\Pr[Y=y]\\) being the marginal probability function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively. Given the joint probability function, we may obtain the marginal probability functions of \\(Y\\) as \\[p(y)=\\sum_x p(x,y),\\] where the summation is over all possible values of \\(x\\), and the marginal probability function of \\(X\\) can be obtained in a similar manner. The conditional probability (mass) function of \\((Y|X)\\) is defined as \\[p(y|x) =\\Pr[Y=y|X=x]= \\frac{p(x,y)}{\\Pr[X=x]},\\] where we may obtain the conditional probability function of \\((X|Y)\\) in a similar manner. In particular, the above conditional probability represents the probability of the event \\(Y=y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\). Hence, even in cases where \\(\\Pr[X=x]=0\\), the function may be given as a particular form, in real applications. 16.1.1.2 Continuous Case For continuous random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we may define their joint probability (density) function based on the joint cumulative distribution function. The joint cumulative distribution function of (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\)) is defined as \\[F(x,y) = \\Pr[X\\leq x, Y\\leq y].\\] When \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, we have \\[F(x,y)=F(x)F(y),\\] with \\(F(x)=\\Pr[X\\leq x]\\) and \\(F(y)=\\Pr[Y\\leq y]\\) being the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively. The random variable \\(X\\) is referred to as a continuous random variable if its cdf is continuous on \\(x\\). When the cdf \\(F(x)\\) is continuous on \\(x\\), then we define \\(f(x)=\\partial F(x)/\\partial x\\) as the (marginal) probability density function (pdf) of \\(X\\). Similarly, if the joint cdf \\(F(x,y)\\) is continuous on both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we define \\[f(x,y)=\\frac{\\partial^2 F(x,y)}{\\partial x\\partial y}\\] as the joint probability density function of (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\)), in which case we refer to the random variables as jointly continuous. When \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, we have \\[f(x,y)=f(x)f(y).\\] Given the joint density function, we may obtain the marginal density function of \\(Y\\) as \\[f(y)=\\int_x f(x,y)\\,dx,\\] where the integral is over all possible values of \\(x\\), and the marginal probability function of \\(X\\) can be obtained in a similar manner. Based on the joint pdfProbability density function and the marginal pdf, we define the conditional probability density function of \\((Y|X)\\) as \\[f(y|x) = \\frac{f(x,y)}{f(x)},\\] where we may obtain the conditional probability function of \\((X|Y)\\) in a similar manner. Here, the conditional density function is the density function of \\(y\\) given \\(X=x\\). Hence, even in cases where \\(\\Pr[X=x]=0\\) or when \\(f(x)\\) is not defined, the function may be given in a particular form in real applications. 16.1.2 Conditional Expectation and Conditional Variance Now we define the conditional expectation and variance based on the conditional distribution defined in the previous subsection. 16.1.2.1 Discrete Case For a discrete random variable \\(Y\\), its expectation is defined as \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y]=\\sum_y y\\,p(y)\\) if its value is finite, and its variance is defined as \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y]=\\mathrm{E}\\{(Y-\\mathrm{E}[Y])^2\\}=\\sum_y y^2\\,p(y)-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y]\\}^2\\) if its value is finite. For a discrete random variable \\(Y\\), the conditional expectation of the random variable \\(Y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) is defined as \\[\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]=\\sum_y y\\,p(y|x),\\] where \\(X\\) does not have to be a discrete variable, as far as the conditional probability function \\(p(y|x)\\) is given. Note that the conditional expectation \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\) is a fixed number. When we replace \\(x\\) with \\(X\\) on the right hand side of the above equation, we can define the expectation of \\(Y\\) given the random variable \\(X\\) as \\[\\mathrm{E}[Y|X]=\\sum_y y\\,p(y|X),\\] which is still a random variable, and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). In a similar manner, we can define the conditional variance of the random variable \\(Y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) as \\[\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X=x]=\\mathrm{E}[Y^2|X=x]-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2=\\sum_y y^2\\,p(y|x)-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2.\\] The variance of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) can be defined by replacing \\(x\\) by \\(X\\) in the above equation, and \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) is still a random variable and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). 16.1.2.2 Continuous Case For a continuous random variable \\(Y\\), its expectation is defined as \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y]=\\int_y y\\,f(y)dy\\) if the integral exists, and its variance is defined as \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y]=\\mathrm{E}\\{(X-\\mathrm{E}[Y])^2\\}=\\int_y y^2\\,f(y)dy-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y]\\}^2\\) if its value is finite. For jointly continuous random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the conditional expectation of the random variable \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\) is defined as \\[\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]=\\int_y y\\,f(y|x)dy.\\] where \\(X\\) does not have to be a continuous variable, as far as the conditional probability function \\(f(y|x)\\) is given. Similarly, the conditional expectation \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\) is a fixed number. When we replace \\(x\\) with \\(X\\) on the right-hand side of the above equation, we can define the expectation of \\(Y\\) given the random variable \\(X\\) as \\[\\mathrm{E}[Y|X]=\\int_y y\\,p(y|X)\\,dy,\\] which is still a random variable, and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). In a similar manner, we can define the conditional variance of the random variable \\(Y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) as \\[\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X=x]=\\mathrm{E}[Y^2|X=x]-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2=\\int_y y^2\\,f(y|x)\\,dy-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2.\\] The variance of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) can then be defined by replacing \\(x\\) by \\(X\\) in the above equation, and similarly \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) is also a random variable and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). 16.2 Iterated Expectations and Total Variance In this section, you learn the Law of Iterated Expectations for calculating the expectation of a random variable based on its conditional distribution given another random variable the Law of Total Variance for calculating the variance of a random variable based on its conditional distribution given another random variable how to calculate the expectation and variance based on an example of a two-stage model 16.2.1 Law of Iterated Expectations Consider two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and \\(h(X,Y)\\), a random variable depending on the function \\(h\\), \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Assuming all the expectations exist and are finite, the Law of Iterated Expectations states that \\[\\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\},\\] where the first (inside) expectation is taken with respect to the random variable \\(Y\\) and the second (outside) expectation is taken with respect to \\(X\\). For the Law of Iterated Expectations, the random variables may be discrete, continuous, or a hybrid combination of the two. We use the example of discrete variables of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to illustrate the calculation of the unconditional expectation using the Law of Iterated Expectations. For continuous random variables, we only need to replace the summation with the integral, as illustrated earlier in the appendix. Given \\(p(y|x)\\) the joint pmfProbability mass function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the conditional expectation of \\(h(X,Y)\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) is defined as \\[\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X=x \\right] = \\sum_y h(x,y) p(y|x),\\] and the conditional expectation of \\(h(X,Y)\\) given \\(X\\) being a random variable can be written as \\[\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] = \\sum_y h(X,y) p(y|X).\\] The unconditional expectation of \\(h(X,Y)\\) can then be obtained by taking the expectation of \\(\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right]\\) with respect to the random variable \\(X\\). That is, we can obtain \\(\\mathrm{E}[ h(X,Y)]\\) as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\} &amp;= \\sum_x \\left\\{\\sum_y h(x,y) p(y|x) \\right \\} p(x) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_x \\sum_y h(x,y) p(y|x)p(x) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_x \\sum_y h(x,y) p(x,y) = \\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)] \\end{aligned}.\\] The Law of Iterated Expectations for the continuous and hybrid cases can be proved in a similar manner, by replacing the corresponding summation(s) by integral(s). 16.2.2 Law of Total Variance Assuming that all the variances exist and are finite, the Law of Total Variance states that \\[\\mathrm{Var}[h(X,Y)]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{Var} \\left[h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\} +\\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\},\\] where the first (inside) expectation/variance is taken with respect to the random variable \\(Y\\) and the second (outside) expectation/variance is taken with respect to \\(X\\). Thus, the unconditional variance equals to the expectation of the conditional variance plus the variance of the conditional expectation. Show Technical Detail In order to verify this rule, first note that we can calculate a conditional variance as \\[\\mathrm{Var} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] = \\mathrm{E} [ h(X,Y)^2 | X ] -\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2.\\] From this, the expectation of the conditional variance is \\[\\begin{align} \\mathrm{E}\\{\\mathrm{Var} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\} &amp;= \\mathrm{E}\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y)^2 | X \\right] \\right\\} - \\mathrm{E}\\left(\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2\\right) \\notag \\\\ &amp;=\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y)^2\\right] - \\mathrm{E}\\left(\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2\\right).\\tag{16.1} \\end{align}\\] Further, note that the conditional expectation, \\(\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right]\\), is a function of \\(X\\), denoted \\(g(X)\\). Thus, \\(g(X)\\) is a random variable with mean \\(\\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)]\\) and variance \\[\\begin{align} \\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\} &amp;=\\mathrm{Var}[g(X)] \\notag \\\\ &amp;= \\mathrm{E}[g(X)^2]\\ - \\left\\{\\mathrm{E}[g(X)]\\right\\}^2 \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;= \\mathrm{E}\\left(\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2\\right) - \\left\\{\\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)]\\right\\}^2.\\tag{16.2} \\end{align}\\] Thus, adding Equations (16.1) and (16.2) leads to the unconditional variance \\(\\mathrm{Var} \\left[ h(X,Y) \\right]\\). 16.2.3 Application To apply the Law of Iterated Expectations and the Law of Total Variance, we generally adopt the following procedure. Identify the random variable that is being conditioned upon, typically a stage 1 outcome (that is not observed). Conditional on the stage 1 outcome, calculate summary measures such as a mean, variance, and the like. There are several results of the step 2, one for each stage 1 outcome. Then, combine these results using the iterated expectations or total variance rules. Mixtures of Finite Populations. Suppose that the random variable \\(N_1\\) represents a realization of the number of claims in a policy year from the population of good drivers and \\(N_2\\) represents that from the population of bad drivers. For a specific driver, there is a probability \\(\\alpha\\) that (s)he is a good driver. For a specific draw \\(N\\), we have \\[N = \\begin{cases} N_1, &amp; \\text{if (s)he is a good driver;}\\\\ N_2, &amp; \\text{otherwise}.\\\\ \\end{cases}\\] Let \\(T\\) be the indicator whether (s)he is a good driver, with \\(T=1\\) representing that the driver is a good driver with \\(\\Pr[T=1]=\\alpha\\) and \\(T=2\\) representing that the driver is a bad driver with \\(\\Pr[T=2]=1-\\alpha\\). From the Law of Iterated Expectations, we can obtain the expected number of claims as \\[ \\mathrm{E}[N]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\}= \\mathrm{E}[N_1] \\times \\alpha + \\mathrm{E}[N_2] \\times (1-\\alpha).\\] From the Law of Total Variance, we can obtain the variance of \\(N\\) as \\[\\mathrm{Var}[N]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{Var} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\} +\\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\}.\\] To be more concrete, suppose that \\(N_j\\) follows a Poisson distribution with the mean \\(\\lambda_j\\), \\(j=1,2\\). Then we have \\[\\mathrm{Var}[N|T=j]= \\mathrm{E}[N|T=j] = \\lambda_j, \\quad j = 1,2.\\] Thus, we can derive the expectation of the conditional variance as \\[\\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{Var} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\} = \\alpha \\lambda_1+ (1-\\alpha) \\lambda_2\\] and the variance of the conditional expectation as \\[\\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\} = (\\lambda_1-\\lambda_2)^2 \\alpha (1-\\alpha).\\] Note that the later is the variance for a Bernoulli with outcomes \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\), and the binomial probability \\(\\alpha\\). Based on the Law of Total Variance, the unconditional variance of \\(N\\) is given by \\[\\mathrm{Var}[N]= \\alpha \\lambda_1+ (1-\\alpha) \\lambda_2 + (\\lambda_1-\\lambda_2)^2 \\alpha (1-\\alpha).\\] 16.3 Conjugate Distributions As described in Section 4.4.1, for conjugate distributions the posterior and the prior come from the same family of distributions. In insurance applications, this broadly occurs in a “family of distribution familes” known as the linear exponential family which we introduce first. 16.3.1 Linear Exponential Family Definition. The distribution of the linear exponential family is \\[\\begin{equation} f( x; \\gamma ,\\theta ) = \\exp \\left( \\frac{x\\gamma -b(\\gamma )}{\\theta} +S\\left( x,\\theta \\right) \\right). \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(x\\) is a dependent variable and \\(\\gamma\\) is the parameter of interest. The quantity \\(\\theta\\) is a scale parameter. The term \\(b(\\gamma)\\) depends only on the parameter \\(\\gamma\\), not the dependent variable. The statistic \\(S\\left(x,\\theta \\right)\\) is a function of the dependent variable and the scale parameter, not the parameter \\(\\gamma\\). The dependent variable \\(x\\) may be discrete, continuous or a hybrid combination of the two. Thus, \\(f\\left( .\\right)\\) may be interpreted to be a density or mass function, depending on the application. The following table provides several examples, including the normal, binomial and Poisson distributions. \\[ {\\small \\begin{matrix} \\text{Selected Distributions of the Linear Exponential Family}\\\\ \\begin{array}{l|ccccc} \\hline &amp; &amp; \\text{Density or} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{Distribution} &amp; \\text{Parameters} &amp; \\text{Mass Function} &amp; \\text{Components} \\\\ \\hline \\text{General} &amp; \\gamma,~ \\theta &amp; \\exp \\left( \\frac{x\\gamma -b(\\gamma )}{\\theta} +S\\left( x,\\theta \\right) \\right) &amp; \\gamma,~ \\theta, b(\\gamma), S(x, \\theta)\\\\ \\text{Normal} &amp; \\mu, \\sigma^2 &amp; \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu )^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}}\\right) &amp; \\mu, \\sigma^2, \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2}, - \\left(\\frac{x^2}{2\\theta} + \\frac{\\ln(2 \\pi \\theta)}{2} \\right) \\\\ \\text{Binomal} &amp; \\pi &amp; {n \\choose x} \\pi ^x (1-\\pi)^{n-x} &amp; \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi} \\right), 1, n \\ln(1+e^{\\gamma} ), \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ln {n \\choose x} \\\\ \\text{Poisson} &amp; \\lambda &amp; \\frac{\\lambda^x}{x!} \\exp(-\\lambda) &amp; \\ln \\lambda, 1, e^{\\gamma}, - \\ln (x!) \\\\ \\text{Negative } &amp; r,p &amp; \\frac{\\Gamma(x+r)}{x!\\Gamma(r)} p^r ( 1-p)^x &amp; \\ln(1-p), 1, -r \\ln(1-e^{\\gamma}), \\\\ ~~~\\text{Binomial}^{\\ast} &amp; &amp; &amp; ~~~\\ln \\left[ \\frac{\\Gamma(x+r)}{x! \\Gamma(r)} \\right] \\\\ \\text{Gamma} &amp; \\alpha, \\theta &amp; \\frac{1}{\\Gamma (\\alpha)\\theta ^ \\alpha} x^{\\alpha -1 }\\exp(-x/ \\theta) &amp; - \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\gamma}, \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, - \\ln ( - \\gamma), -\\theta^{-1} \\ln \\theta \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; - \\ln \\left( \\Gamma(\\theta ^{-1}) \\right) + (\\theta^{-1} - 1) \\ln x &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\\\ ^{\\ast} \\text{This assumes that the parameter r is fixed but need not be an integer.}\\\\ \\end{matrix} } \\] The Tweedie (see Section ??) and inverse Gaussian distributions are also members of the linear exponential family. The linear exponential family of distribution families is extensively used as the basis of generalized linear models as described in, for example, Edward W. Frees (2009a). 16.3.2 Conjugate Distributions Now assume that the parameter \\(\\gamma\\) is random with distribution \\(\\pi(\\gamma, \\tau)\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is a vector of parameters that describe the distribution of \\(\\gamma\\). In Bayesian models, the distribution \\(\\pi\\) is known as the prior and reflects our belief or information about \\(\\gamma\\). The likelihood \\(f(x|\\gamma)\\) is a probability conditional on \\(\\gamma\\). The distribution of \\(\\gamma\\) with knowledge of the random variables, \\(\\pi(\\gamma,\\tau| x)\\), is called the posterior distribution. For a given likelihood distribution, priors and posteriors that come from the same parametric family are known as conjugate families of distributions. For a linear exponential likelihood, there exists a natural conjugate family. Specifically, consider a likelihood of the form \\(f(x|\\gamma) = \\exp \\left\\{(x\\gamma -b(\\gamma))/\\theta\\right\\} \\exp \\left\\{S\\left( x,\\theta \\right) \\right\\}\\). For this likelihood, define the prior distribution \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1(\\tau) - b(\\gamma)a_2(\\tau))\\right\\}, \\] where \\(C\\) is a normalizing constant. Here, \\(a_1(\\tau)=a_1\\) and \\(a_2(\\tau)=a_2\\) are functions of the parameters \\(\\tau\\) although we simplify the notation by dropping explicit dependence on \\(\\tau\\). The joint distribution of \\(x\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) is given by \\(f(x,\\gamma) = f(x|\\gamma) \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau)\\). Using Bayes Theorem, the posterior distribution is \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau|x) = C_1 \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma \\left( a_1+\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right) - b(\\gamma)\\left( a_2+\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}, \\] where \\(C_1\\) is a normalizing constant. Thus, we see that \\(\\pi(\\gamma,\\tau|x)\\) has the same form as \\(\\pi(\\gamma,\\tau)\\). Special case. Poisson-Gamma Model. Consider a Poisson likelihood so that \\(b(\\gamma) = e^{\\gamma}\\) and scale parameter (\\(\\theta\\)) equals one. Thus, we have \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1 - a_2 e^{\\gamma} \\right\\}= C ~ \\left( e^{\\gamma}\\right)^{a_1} \\exp\\left(-a_2e^{\\gamma} \\right). \\] From the table of exponential family distributions, we recognize this to be a gamma distribution. That is, we have that the prior distribution of \\(\\lambda = e^{\\gamma}\\) is a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_{prior} = a_1+1\\) and \\(\\theta_{prior}^{-1}=a_2\\). The posterior distribution is a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_{post} =a_1+x+1=\\alpha_{prior}+x\\) and \\(\\theta_{post}^{-1}=a_2+1 = \\theta_{prior}^{-1}+1\\). This is consistent with our Section ?? result. Special case. Normal-Normal Model. Consider a normal likelihood so that \\(b(\\gamma) = \\gamma^2/2\\) and the scale parameter is \\(\\sigma^2\\). Thus, we have \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2}a_2\\right\\}= C_1(\\tau)\\exp\\left\\{ - \\frac{a_2}{2}\\left(\\gamma -\\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\right)^2\\right\\}, \\] The prior distribution of \\(\\gamma\\) is normal with mean \\(a_1/a_2\\) and variance \\(a_2^{-1}\\). The posterior distribution of \\(\\gamma\\) given \\(x\\) is normal with mean \\((a_1+x/\\sigma^2)/(a_2+\\sigma^{-2})\\) and variance \\((a_2+\\sigma^{-2})^{-1}\\). Special case. Beta-Binomial Model. Consider a binomial likelihood so that \\(b(\\gamma) = n \\ln(1+e^{\\gamma})\\) and scale parameter equals one. Thus, we have \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1 - n a_2 \\ln(1+e^{\\gamma}) \\right\\}= C ~ \\left( \\frac{e^{\\gamma}}{1+e^{\\gamma}}\\right)^{a_1} \\left(1-\\frac{e^{\\gamma}}{1+e^{\\gamma}}\\right)^{-na_2+a_1}. \\] This is a beta distribution. As in the other cases, prior parameters \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) are updated to become posterior parameters \\(a_1+x\\) and \\(a_2+1\\).

Appendix Chapter 15 introduced the maximum likelihood theory regarding estimation of parameters from a parametric family. This appendix gives more specific examples and expands some of the concepts. Section 17.1 reviews the definition of the likelihood function, and introduces its properties. Section 17.2 reviews the maximum likelihood estimators, and extends their large-sample properties to the case where there are multiple parameters in the model. Section 17.3 reviews statistical inference based on maximum likelihood estimators, with specific examples on cases with multiple parameters. 17.1 Likelihood Function In this section, you learn the definitions of the likelihood function and the log-likelihood function the properties of the likelihood function. From Appendix 15, the likelihood function is a function of parameters given the observed data. Here, we review the concepts of the likelihood function, and introduces its properties that are bases for maximum likelihood inference. 17.1.1 Likelihood and Log-likelihood Functions Here, we give a brief review of the likelihood function and the log-likelihood function from Appendix 15. Let \\(f(\\cdot|\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\) be the probability function of \\(X\\), the probability mass function (pmf) if \\(X\\) is discrete or the probability density function (pdf) if it is continuous. The likelihood is a function of the parameters (\\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\)) given the data (\\(\\mathbf{x}\\)). Hence, it is a function of the parameters with the data being fixed, rather than a function of the data with the parameters being fixed. The vector of data \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is usually a realization of a random sample as defined in Appendix 15. Given a realized of a random sample \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)\\) of size \\(n\\), the likelihood function is defined as \\[L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=f(\\mathbf{x}|\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\prod_{i=1}^nf(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\] with the corresponding log-likelihood function given by \\[l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\ln L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\ln f(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\] where \\(f(\\mathbf{x}|\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) denotes the joint probability function of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). The log-likelihood function leads to an additive structure that is easy to work with. In Appendix 15, we have used the normal distribution to illustrate concepts of the likelihood function and the log-likelihood function. Here, we derive the likelihood and corresponding log-likelihood functions when the population distribution is from the Pareto distribution family. Show Example Example – Pareto Distribution. Suppose that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) represents a random sample from a single-parameter Pareto distribution with the cumulative distribution function given by \\[F(x) = \\Pr(X_i\\leq x)=1- \\left(\\frac{500}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}, ~~~~ x&gt;500,\\] where the parameter \\(\\theta = \\alpha\\). The corresponding probability density function is \\(f(x) = 500^{\\alpha} \\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1}\\) and the log-likelihood function can be derived as \\[l(\\boldsymbol \\alpha|\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln f(x_i;\\alpha) = n \\alpha \\ln 500 +n \\ln \\alpha -(\\alpha+1) \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln x_i .\\] 17.1.2 Properties of Likelihood Functions In mathematical statistics, the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameters, \\(u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=\\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})/\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\), is referred to as the score function, or the score vector when there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\). The score function or score vector can be written as \\[u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=\\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) =\\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\ln \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\\boldsymbol \\theta ) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\ln f(x_i;\\boldsymbol \\theta ),\\] where \\(u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=(u_1(\\boldsymbol\\theta),u_2(\\boldsymbol\\theta),\\cdots,u_p(\\boldsymbol\\theta))\\) when \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta=(\\theta_1,\\cdots,\\theta_p)\\) contains \\(p&gt;2\\) parameters, with the element \\(u_k(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=\\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})/\\partial \\theta_k\\) being the partial derivative with respect to \\(\\theta_k\\) (\\(k=1,2,\\cdots,p\\)). The likelihood function has the following properties: One basic property of the likelihood function is that the expectation of the score function with respect to \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is 0. That is, \\[\\mathrm{E}[u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)]=\\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right] = \\mathbf 0\\] To illustrate this, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right] &amp;= \\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\frac{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta}f(\\mathbf{x};\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{f(\\mathbf{x};\\boldsymbol \\theta )} \\right] = \\int\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} f(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta ) d \\mathbf y \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\int f(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta ) d \\mathbf y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} 1 = \\mathbf 0.\\end{aligned}\\] Denote by \\({ \\partial^2 l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) }/{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}}={ \\partial^2 l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) }/{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{2}}\\) the second derivative of the log-likelihood function when \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) is a single parameter, or by \\({ \\partial^2 l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) }/{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}}=(h_{jk})=({ \\partial^2 l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) }/\\partial x_j\\partial x_k)\\) the hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function when it contains multiple parameters. Denote \\([{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta}][{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta&#39;}]=u^2(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) when \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) is a single parameter, or let \\([{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta}][{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta&#39;}]=(uu_{jk})\\) be a \\(p\\times p\\) matrix when \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) contains a total of \\(p\\) parameters, with each element \\(uu_{jk}=u_j(\\boldsymbol \\theta)u_k(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) and \\(u_j(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) being the \\(k\\)th element of the score vector as defined earlier. Another basic property of the likelihood function is that sum of the expectation of the hessian matrix and the expectation of the kronecker product of the score vector and its transpose is \\(\\mathbf 0\\). That is, \\[\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2 }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right) + \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta} \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}}\\right) = \\mathbf 0.\\] Define the Fisher information matrix as \\[ \\mathcal{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} \\right) = -\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta \\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right).\\] As the sample size \\(n\\) goes to infinity, the score function (vector) converges in distribution to a normal distribution (or multivariate normal distribution when \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) contains multiple parameters) with mean 0 and variance (or covariance matrix in the multivariate case) given by \\(\\mathcal{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). 17.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimators In this section, you learn the definition and derivation of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for parameters from a specific distribution family the properties of maximum likelihood estimators that ensure valid large-sample inference of the parameters why using the MLE-based method, and what caution that needs to be taken. In statistics, maximum likelihood estimators are values of the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) that are most likely to have been produced by the data. 17.2.1 Definition and Derivation of MLE Based on the definition given in Appendix 15, the value of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), say \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}_{MLE}\\), that maximizes the likelihood function, is called the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\). Because the log function \\(\\ln(\\cdot)\\) is a one-to-one function, we can also determine \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}\\) by maximizing the log-likelihood function, \\(l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})\\). That is, the MLE is defined as \\[\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}_{MLE}={\\mbox{argmax}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\in\\Theta}l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x}).\\] Given the analytical form of the likelihood function, the MLE can be obtained by taking the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), and setting the values of the partial derivatives to zero. That is, the MLE are the solutions of the equations of \\[\\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}=\\mathbf 0.\\] Show Example Example. Course C/Exam 4. May 2000, 21. You are given the following five observations: 521, 658, 702, 819, 1217. You use the single-parameter Pareto with cumulative distribution function: \\[F(x) = 1- \\left(\\frac{500}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}, ~~~~ x&gt;500 .\\] Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter \\(\\alpha\\). Show Example Solution Solution. With \\(n=5\\), the log-likelihood function is \\[l(\\alpha|\\mathbf{x} ) = \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln f(x_i;\\alpha ) = 5 \\alpha \\ln 500 + 5 \\ln \\alpha -(\\alpha+1) \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln x_i.\\] Solving for the root of the score function yields \\[\\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\alpha } l(\\alpha |\\mathbf{x}) = 5 \\ln 500 + 5 / \\alpha - \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln x_i =_{set} 0 \\Rightarrow \\hat{\\alpha}_{MLE} = \\frac{5}{\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\ln x_i - 5 \\ln 500 } = 2.453 .\\] 17.2.2 Asymptotic Properties of MLE From Appendix 15, the MLEMaximum likelihood estimate has some nice large-sample properties, under certain regularity conditions. We presented the results for a single parameter in Appendix 15, but results are true for the case when \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) contains multiple parameters. In particular, we have the following results, in a general case when \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\cdots,\\theta_p)\\). The MLE of a parameter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}\\), is a consistent estimator. That is, the MLE \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}\\) converges in probability to the true value \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), as the sample size \\(n\\) goes to infinity. The MLE has the asymptotic normality property, meaning that the estimator will converge in distribution to a multivariate normal distribution centered around the true value, when the sample size goes to infinity. Namely, \\[\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rightarrow N\\left(\\mathbf 0,\\,\\boldsymbol{V}\\right),\\quad \\mbox{as}\\quad n\\rightarrow \\infty,\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{V}\\) denotes the asymptotic variance (or covariance matrix) of the estimator. Hence, the MLE \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}\\) has an approximate normal distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) and variance (covariance matrix when \\(p&gt;1\\)) \\(\\boldsymbol{V}/n\\), when the sample size is large. The MLE is efficient, meaning that it has the smallest asymptotic variance \\(\\boldsymbol{V}\\), commonly referred to as the Cramer–Rao lower bound. In particular, the Cramer–Rao lower bound is the inverse of the Fisher information (matrix) \\(\\mathcal{I}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) defined earlier in this appendix. Hence, \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE})\\) can be estimated based on the observed Fisher information. Based on the above results, we may perform statistical inference based on the procedures defined in Appendix 15. Show Example Example. Course C/Exam 4. Nov 2000, 13. A sample of ten observations comes from a parametric family \\(f(x,; \\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\) with log-likelihood function \\[l(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)= \\sum_{i=1}^{10} f(x_i; \\theta_1, \\theta_2) = -2.5 \\theta_1^2 - 3 \\theta_1 \\theta_2 - \\theta_2^2 + 5 \\theta_1 + 2 \\theta_2 + k,\\] where \\(k\\) is a constant. Determine the estimated covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimator, \\(\\hat{\\theta_1}, \\hat{\\theta_2}\\). Show Example Solution Solution. Denoting \\(l=l(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\), the hessian matrix of second derivatives is \\[\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 ^2 } l &amp; \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 \\partial \\theta_2 } l \\\\ \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 \\partial \\theta_2 } l &amp; \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 ^2 } l \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -5 &amp; -3 \\\\ -3 &amp; -2 \\end{array} \\right)\\] Thus, the information matrix is: \\[\\mathcal{I}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = -\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta \\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 3 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 \\end{array} \\right)\\] and \\[\\mathcal{I}^{-1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{5(2) - 3(3)}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3 \\\\ -3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3 \\\\ -3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) .\\] 17.2.3 Use of Maximum Likelihood Estimation The method of maximum likelihood has many advantages over alternative methods such as the method of moment method introduced in Appendix 15. It is a general tool that works in many situations. For example, we may be able to write out the closed-form likelihood function for censored and truncated data. Maximum likelihood estimation can be used for regression models including covariates, such as survival regression, generalized linear models and mixed models, that may include covariates that are time-dependent. From the efficiency of the MLE, it is optimal, the best, in the sense that it has the smallest variance among the class of all unbiased estimators for large sample sizes. From the results on the asymptotic normality of the MLE, we can obtain a large-sample distribution for the estimator, allowing users to assess the variability in the estimation and perform statistical inference on the parameters. The approach is less computationally extensive than re-sampling methods that require a large of fittings of the model. Despite its numerous advantages, MLE has its drawback in cases such as generalized linear models when it does not have a closed analytical form. In such cases, maximum likelihood estimators are computed iteratively using numerical optimization methods. For example, we may use the Newton-Raphson iterative algorithm or its variations for obtaining the MLE. Iterative algorithms require starting values. For some problems, the choice of a close starting value is critical, particularly in cases where the likelihood function has local minimums or maximums. Hence, there may be a convergence issue when the starting value is far from the maximum. Hence, it is important to start from different values across the parameter space, and compare the maximized likelihood or log-likelihood to make sure the algorithms have converged to a global maximum. 17.3 Statistical Inference Based on Maximum Likelhood Estimation In this section, you learn how to perform hypothesis testing based on MLE for cases where there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) perform likelihood ratio test for cases where there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) In Appendix 15, we have introduced maximum likelihood-based methods for statistical inference when \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) contains a single parameter. Here, we will extend the results to cases where there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\). 17.3.1 Hypothesis Testing In Appendix 15, we defined hypothesis testing concerning the null hypothesis, a statement on the parameter(s) of a distribution or model. One important type of inference is to assess whether a parameter estimate is statistically significant, meaning whether the value of the parameter is zero or not. We have learned earlier that the MLE \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}\\) has a large-sample normal distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) and the variance covariance matrix \\(\\mathcal{I}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Based on the multivariate normal distribution, the \\(j\\)th element of \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}\\), say \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j}\\), has a large-sample univariate normal distribution. Define \\(se(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})\\), the standard error (estimated standard deviation) to be the square root of the \\(j\\)th diagonal element of \\(\\mathcal{I}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)_{MLE}\\). To assess the null hypothesis that \\(\\theta_j=\\theta_0\\), we define the \\(t\\)-statistic or \\(t\\)-ratio to be \\(t(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})=(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j}-\\theta_0)/se(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})\\). Under the null hypothesis, it has a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(n-p\\), with \\(p\\) being the dimension of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). For most actuarial applications, we have a large sample size \\(n\\), so the \\(t\\)-distribution is very close to the (standard) normal distribution. In the case when \\(n\\) is very large or when the standard error is known, the \\(t\\)-statistic can be referred to as a \\(z\\)-statistic or \\(z\\)-score. Based on the results from Appendix 15, if the \\(t\\)-statistic \\(t(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})\\) exceeds a cut-off (in absolute value), then the test for the \\(j\\) parameter \\(\\theta_j\\) is said to be statistically significant. If \\(\\theta_j\\) is the regression coefficient of the \\(j\\) th independent variable, then we say that the \\(j\\)th variable is statistically significant. For example, if we use a 5% significance level, then the cut-off value is 1.96 using a normal distribution approximation for cases with a large sample size. More generally, using a \\(100 \\alpha \\%\\) significance level, then the cut-off is a \\(100(1-\\alpha/2)\\%\\) quantile from a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with the degree of freedom being \\(n-p\\). Another useful concept in hypothesis testing is the \\(p\\)-value, shorthand for probability value. From the mathematical definition in Appendix 15, a \\(p\\)-value is defined as the smallest significance level for which the null hypothesis would be rejected. Hence, the \\(p\\)-value is a useful summary statistic for the data analyst to report because it allows the reader to understand the strength of statistical evidence concerning the deviation from the null hypothesis. 17.3.2 MLE and Model Validation In addition to hypothesis testing and interval estimation introduced in Appendix 15 and the previous subsection, another important type of inference is selection of a model from two choices, where one choice is a special case of the other with certain parameters being restricted. For such two models with one being nested in the other, we have introduced the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in Appendix 15. Here, we will briefly review the process of performing a LRT based on a specific example of two alternative models. Suppose that we have a (large) model under which we derive the maximum likelihood estimator, \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}\\). Now assume that some of the \\(p\\) elements in \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) are equal to zero and determine the maximum likelihood estimator over the remaining set, with the resulting estimator denoted \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{Reduced}\\). Based on the definition in Appendix 15, the statistic, \\(LRT= 2 \\left( l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{MLE}) - l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{Reduced}) \\right)\\), is called the likelihood ratio statistic. Under the null hypothesis that the reduced model is correct, the likelihood ratio has a Chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(d\\), the number of variables set to zero. Such a test allows us to judge which of the two models is more likely to be correct, given the observed data. If the statistic \\(LRT\\) is large relative to the critical value from the chi-square distribution, then we reject the reduced model in favor of the larger one. Details regarding the critical value and alternative methods based on information criteria are given in Appendix 15. Contributors Lei (Larry) Hua, Northern Illinois University, and Edward W.
